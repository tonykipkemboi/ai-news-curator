# AI Research & Engineering Digest

## 1. Executive Summary (The Pulse)
Today's AI landscape emphasizes robust security measures for agents, efficient orchestration of multi-agent workflows, and vertical application of AI in CAD and financial contexts, with a focus on verifiable safety in sensitive domains like healthcare. Linear attention mechanisms are gaining traction, addressing the context collapse issue.

## 2. 🔥 The 1% Signal (Must-Read)
The MHLA: Restoring Expressivity of Linear Attention via Token-Level Multi-Head paper introduces a critical improvement to linear attention, addressing the 'global context collapse' issue that limits its effectiveness. MHLA achieves this by dividing input tokens into heads and computing query-conditioned mixtures over key-value summaries within each head. This approach preserves linear complexity (O(N)) while significantly enhancing representational diversity. By leveraging standard GEMMs and retaining streaming compatibility, MHLA offers a production-ready upgrade for Transformer architectures in areas like high-resolution image and video processing.

## 3. 💡 Founder's Corner (Opportunities)

*   **Problem:** Existing containerization (Docker) isn't sufficient for securing AI coding agents against prompt injection, data exfiltration, or accidental destructive actions. .env files are insufficient for secret management.
    *   **Opportunity:** Develop a more robust AI agent security framework, including kernel-level isolation (e.g., Podman machines, virtual machines, or specialized OS like Qubes OS), fine-grained network control, secure SSH agent implementations, and encrypted credential storage.

*   **Problem:** Managing multiple AI agent sessions, especially for coding, is cumbersome and lacks efficient orchestration. CLI experiences are slow, and persistent sessions are missing for self-hosted models.
    *   **Opportunity:** Build tools for AI agent workflow management and orchestration, focusing on efficient collaboration, session persistence across reboots, and clean APIs for programmatic agent control, including hotkey controls for idle worker switching.
