A better baseline for comparison would be Nvidia&#x27;s cuEquivariance, which does pretty much the same thing as you did- take e3nn and optimize it for GPU.<p>As a HPC developer, it breaks my heart how worse academic software performance is compared to vendor libraries (from Intel or Nvidia). We need to start aiming much higher."

Meanwhile the image decoding can take a while when you want to have a quick thumbnail overview showing all those hundred pages at once. No comic&#x2F;ebook software I have ever touched as managed to match the responsiveness of an actual book where you can flip through those hundreds of pages  in a second with zero loading time, despite it being somewhat trivial to implement when you generate the necessary thumbnail&#x2F;image-pyramid data first.<p>A multi-resolution image format would make more sense than optimizing the archive format.

      "I worked with Mastra for three months and it is awesome. Thank you for making a great product.<p>One thing to consider is that it felt clunky working with workflows and branching logic with non LLM agents. I have a strong preference for using rules based logic and heuristics first. That way, if I do need to bring in the big gun LLM models, I already have the context engineering solved. To me, an agent means anything with agency. After a couple weeks of frustration, I started using my own custom branching workflows.<p>One reason to use rules, they are free and 10,000x faster, with an LLM agent fallback if validation rules were not passing. Instead of running an LLM agent to solve a problem every single time, I can have the LLM write the rules once. The whole thing got messy.<p>Otherwise, Mastra is best in class for working with TypeScript.",

      "Bear in mind that there is a lot of money riding on LLMs leading to cost savings, and development (seen as expensive and a common bottleneck) is a huge opportunity. There are paid (micro) influencer campaigns going on and what not.<p>Also bear in mind that a lot of folks want to be seen as being on the bleeding edge, including famous people. They get money from people booking them for courses and consulting, buying their books, products and stuff. A &quot;personal brand&quot; can have a lot of value. They can&#x27;t be seen as obsolete. They&#x27;re likely to talk about what could or will be, more than about what currently is. Money isn&#x27;t always the motive for sure, people also want to be considered useful, they want to genuinely play around and try and see where things are going.<p>All that said, I think your approach is fine. If you don&#x27;t inspect what the agent is doing, you&#x27;re down to faith. Is it the fastest way to get _something_ working? Probably not. Is it the best way to build an understanding of the capabilities and pit falls? I&#x27;d say so.<p>This stuff is relatively new, I don&#x27;t think anyone has truly figured out how to best approach LLM assisted development yet. A lot of folks are on it, usually not exactly following the scientific method. We&#x27;ll get evidence eventually.",
      "The short answer to your question is “yes”. I’ve been a part of projects that largely leveraged agentic coding tools and produced net posititve results. BUT, we didn’t skip code review and we didn’t lower the bar for what good code looks like.<p>In my personal experience (working as part of a team and not a solo dev), good documentation and well-documented&#x2F;enforced practices can produce great results.

      "It really depends by what you mean by &quot;it works&quot;. A retrospective of the last 6months.<p>I&#x27;ve had great success coding infra (terraform). It at least 10x the generation of easily verifiable and tedious to write code. Results were audited to death as the client was highly regulated.<p>Professional feature dev is hit and miss for sure, although getting better and better. We&#x27;re nowhere near full agentic coding. However, by reinvesting the speed gains from not writing boilerplate into devex and tests&#x2F;security, I bring to life much better quality software, maintainable and a boy to work with.<p>I suddenly have the homelab of my dreams, all the ideas previously in the &quot;too long to execute&quot; category now get vibe coded while watching TV or doing other stuff.<p>As an old jaded engineer, everything code was getting a bit boring and repetitive (so many rest APIs). I guess you get the most value out of it when you know exactly what you want.<p>Most importantly though, and I&#x27;ve heard this from a few other seniors: I&#x27;ve found joy in making cool fun things with tech again. I like that new way of creating stuff at the speed of thought, and I guess for me that counts as &quot;it works&quot;",
      "I think one fatal flaw is letting the agent build the app from scratch. I&#x27;ve had <i>huge</i> success with agents, but only on existing apps that were architected by humans and have established conventions and guardrails. Agents are really bad at architecture, but quite good at following suit.<p>Other things that seem to contribute to success with agents are:<p>- Static type systems (not tacked-on like Typescript)<p>- A test suite where the tests cover large swaths of code (i.e. not just unit testing individual functions; you want e2e-style tests, but not the flaky browser kind)<p>With all the above boxes ticked, I can get away with only doing &quot;sampled&quot; reviews. I.e. I don&#x27;t review every single change, but I do review some of them. And if I find anything weird that I had missed from a previous change, I to tell it to fix it and give the fix a full review. For architectural changes, I plan the change myself, <i>start</i> working on it, then tell the agent to finish.",

Note that I limited it to pure C with limited dependencies; initial prompt was just to get text output (&quot;Heart Rate 76bpm&quot;), when it got to that point I told Claude to add a web interface followed by creating a realtime graph to show the interface in use.<p>Every file is claude generated. AMA.<p>edit: this was particularly interesting as it had to test against the HRM sensor I was wearing during development, and to cope with bluetooth devices appearing and disappearing all the time.

      "I&#x27;ve been programming for 20 years, and I&#x27;ve <i>always</i> been under-estimating how long things will take (no, not pressured by anyone to give firm estimates, just talking about informally when prioritizing work order together).<p>The other day I gave an estimate to my co-worker and he said &quot;but how long is it really going to take, because you always finish a lot quicker than you say, you say two weeks and then it takes two days&quot;.<p>The LLMs will just make me finish things a lot faster and my gut feel estimation for how long things will take still is not yet taking that into account.<p>(And before people talk about typing speed: No that isn&#x27;t it at all. I&#x27;ve always been the fastest typer and fastest human developer among my close co-workers.)<p>Yes, I need to review the code and interact with the agent. But it&#x27;s doing a lot better than a lot of developers I&#x27;ve worked with over the years, and if I don&#x27;t like the style of the code it takes very few words and the LLM will &quot;get it&quot; and it will improve it..<p>Some commenters are comparing the LLM to a junior. In some sense that is right in that the work relationship may be the same as towards a (blazingly fast) junior; but the communication style and knowledge area and how few words I can use to describe something feels more like talking to a senior.<p>(I think it may help that latest 10 years of my career a big part of my job was reviewing other people&#x27;s code, delegating tasks, being the one who knew the code base best and helping others into it. So that means I&#x27;m used to delegating not just coding. Recently I switched jobs and am now coding alone with AI.)",
      "I use Augment with Claud Opus 4.5 every day at my job. I barely ever write code by hand anymore. I don&#x27;t blindly accept the code that it writes, I iterate with it. We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools.<p>I&#x27;ve implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools.<p>A few very concrete advantages I&#x27;ve found:<p>* I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away.<p>* It&#x27;s greatly improved my ability in languages I&#x27;m not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I&#x27;ve maintained for a decade or so. I&#x27;m quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, &quot;improve this extension&quot;) and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I&#x27;m not.<p>Here&#x27;s the approach I follow that works pretty well:<p>1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you.<p>2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step.<p>4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...).<p>5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.)<p>This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial.",
      "Shipping unreviewed, untested code into production is irresponsible. But not all code is production code, and in my experience most valuable work happens long before anything deserves architectural sign-off &#x2F; big commercial commitment.<p>Exploratory scripts, glue code—what I think of as digital duct tape between systems—scaffolding, probes, and throwaway POCs have always been messy and lightly governed. That’s kind of normal.<p>What’s different now is that more people can participate in that phase, and we’re judging that work by the same norms and processes we use for production systems. I know more designers now who are unafraid to code than ever before. That might be problematic or fantastic.<p>Where agentic coding does work for me is explicitly in those early modes, or where my own knowledge is extremely thin or I don’t have the luxury of writing everything myself (time etc). Things that simply wouldn’t get made otherwise: feasibility checks, bridging gaps between systems, or showing a half-formed idea fast enough to decide whether it’s worth formalising.<p>In those contexts, technical debt isn’t really debt, because the artefact isn’t meant to live long enough to accrue interest or be used in anger.<p>So I don’t think the real question is &quot;does agentic coding work?&quot; It’s whether teams are willing to clearly separate exploratory agency from production authority, and enforce a hard line between the two. ( I dont think they&#x27;ll know the difference sadly) and without that, you’re right—you just get spaghetti that passes today and punishes EVERYONE six months later.",

But it&#x27;s head-and-shoulders above what I could do in the last iteration of Claude.<p>I can experiment super quickly: Try caching previously encountered keys and show me the performance change. 5 mins, done. Would take me a LOT longer to retool the code just for a quick test. Experiments are dirt cheap now.<p>The biggest bottleneck right now is that I keep hitting my token limits 1-2 hours before each reset ;-)",
      "Here&#x27;s a pattern I noticed - you notice some pattern that is working (let&#x27;s say planning or TODO management) - if the pattern is indeed solid then it gets integrated into the black box and your agent starts doing that internally. At which point your abstraction on top becomes defective because agents get confused about planning the planning.<p>So with the top performers I think what&#x27;s most effective is just stating clearly what the end result you want to be (with maybe some hints for verification of results which is just clarifying the intent more)",
      "I sometimes feel like the cognitive cost of agentic coding is so much higher than a skilled human. There is so much more bootstrap and handling process around making sure agents don&#x27;t go off the rails (they will), or that they will adhere to their goals (they won&#x27;t). And in my experience fixing issues downstream takes more effort than solving the issue at the root.<p>The pipe dream of agents handling Github Issue -&gt; PullRequest -&gt; Resolve Issue becomes a nightmare of fixing downstream regressions or other chaos unleashed by agents given too much privilege. I think people optimistic on agents are either naive or hype merchants grifting&#x2F;shilling.<p>I can understand the grinning panic of the hype merchants because we&#x27;ve collectively shovelled so much capital into AI with very little to show for it so far. Not to say that AI is useless, far from it, but there&#x27;s far more over-optimism than realistic assessment of the actual accuracy and capabilities."

      "Hi! I work on TUI rendering for Claude Code. I know this has been a long-standing frustration — it&#x27;s taken longer than any of us wanted.<p>The good news: we shipped our differential renderer to everyone today. We rewrote our rendering system from scratch[1] and only ~1&#x2F;3 of sessions see at least a flicker. Very, very few sessions see flickers in rapid succession which was so annoying before. Those numbers will keep dropping as people update.<p>We&#x27;ve also been working upstream to add synchronized output &#x2F; DEC mode 2026 support to environments where CC runs and have had patches accepted to VSCode&#x27;s terminal[2]  and tmux[3]. Synchronized output totally eliminates flickering. As always, I recommend using Ghostty which has 2026 support and zero flicker.<p>Happy to answer questions!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anthropics&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;issues&#x2F;769#issuecomment-3667315590\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anthropics&#x2F;claude-code&#x2F;issues&#x2F;769#issueco...</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xtermjs&#x2F;xterm.js&#x2F;pull&#x2F;5453\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xtermjs&#x2F;xterm.js&#x2F;pull&#x2F;5453</a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tmux&#x2F;tmux&#x2F;pull&#x2F;4744\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tmux&#x2F;tmux&#x2F;pull&#x2F;4744</a>",

And I have to restart the terminal and Claude Code for it to behave well again. But I don&#x27;t know if this is the flickering issue, or if it&#x27;s due to a bug in Windows, Alacritty, Zsh or something else.",
      "I would love to use this but it breaks Ghostty&#x27;s native scrollback (two-finger scroll), which I want more than I want to solve the flickering. The PTY proxy intercepts the output stream so Ghostty can&#x27;t access its internal scrollback buffer anymore.",
      "It is very 2026, that this exists for the product by a company that goes all in on vibe coding. Kudos for the creative solution.",
      "I have not used Claude Code in a couple months. THEY HAVEN’T FIXED THIS YET?<p>I’m starting to think that the reason why anthropic doesn’t open source Claude code isn’t due to competitive reasons, it’s because they don’t want people to see what a mess their code base is.<p>Maybe they bought Bun to increase the rate of flickering so that the text looks solid again",

It maintains just the right balance to fuel creativity while maintaining structure across different ranges of tasks.<p>&gt; So my approach changed. I decided to build my skill using the same pattern: detailing my design principles but framing them in an evocative way to force Claude to deeply explore the task domain before any visual output (feel free to tear apart my approach, but hey, it works). Since then I&#x27;ve been getting way more thoughtful initial output from Claude rather than it defaulting to the safe UI patterns it was trained on.<p>This is kind of unclear language to me.
