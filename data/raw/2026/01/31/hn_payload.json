      "Super nice, thanks for sharing!<p>There&#x27;s one thing that gave me pause: \nIn the phrase 我想学中文 it identified &quot;wén&quot; as &quot;guó&quot;. While my pronunciation isn&#x27;t perfect, there&#x27;s no way that what I said is closer to &quot;guó&quot; than to &quot;wén&quot;.<p>This indicates to me that the model learned word structures instead of tones here. &quot;Zhōng guó&quot; probably appears in the training data a lot, so the model has a bias towards recognizing that.<p>- Edit -<p>From the blog post:<p>&gt; If my tone is wrong, I don’t want the model to guess what I meant. I want it to tell me what I actually said.<p>Your architecture <i>also</i> doesn&#x27;t tell you what you actually said. It just <i>maps</i> what you said to the likeliest of the 1254 syllables that you allow. For example, it couldn&#x27;t tell you that you said &quot;wi&quot; or &quot;wr&quot; instead of &quot;wo&quot;, because those syllables don&#x27;t exist in your setup.",
      "As a native speaker of Mandarin the demo it&#x27;s not work for me. It can&#x27;t check the pronounce of my voice. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong of it, may be it&#x27;s too sensitive(my daughter watch carton on my side).",
      "Impressive work! The idea and the UI is very intuitive.<p>Though, as a guy who speaks perfect mandarin from Beijing, I’m struggle even to pass the easy ones… So it can definitely used some improvements. The example 你好吃饭了吗 returns hào → hǎo, fān → fàn, le → liǎo. The first two are the model listen my tone mistakenly, and the last one should be le instead of liǎo in this context.<p>Also I see in the comment section people are worry about tones. I can guarantee tones are not particularly useful and you can communicate with native speakers with all the tones messed up and that’s perfectly fine. Because as soon as you leave Beijing, you’ll find all the tones are shuffled because of every region has their own dialect and accents, which doesn’t stop people from communicate at all. So don’t let tone stuff slow your learning process down.",
      "Longtime lurker, made an account specifically to give feedback here as an intermediate speaker. :)<p>This is a great initiative and I hope to see more come out of this; I am not criticizing, but just want to provide my user experience here so you have data points.<p>In short, my experience lines up with your native speakers.<p>I found that it loses track of the phonemes when speaking quickly, and tones don&#x27;t seem to line up when speaking at normal conversational speed.<p>For example, if I say 他是我的朋友 at normal conversational speed, it will assign `de` to 我, sometimes it interprets that I didn&#x27;t have the retroflexive in `shi` and renders it `si`. Listened back to make sure I said everything, the phonemes are there in the recording, but the UI displays the wrong phonemes and tones.<p>By contrast, if I speak slowly and really push each tone, the phonemes and tones all register correctly.<p>Also, is this taking into account tone transformation? Example, third tones (bottom out tone) tend to smoosh into a second tone (rising) when multiple third tones are spoken in a row. Sometimes the first tone influences the next tone slightly, etc.<p>Again, great initiative, but I think it needs a way to deal with speech that is conversationally spoken and maybe even slurred a bit due to the nature of conversational level speech.",
      "This is sick... you can just do things :D",
      "Anyone that is a native European language speaker that hasn&#x27;t tried to learn Chinese or some other tonal language, its really hard to understand how hard it is. The tones can really be very subtle, and your ear is not fine tuned to them. So you <i>think</i> you are saying it right, but native speakers have no idea what you are saying.",
      "I think this is a good time for a shameless plug. The last 2 month or so I am working on my own project [1] for learning more characters. I have made a tool with powerful search function, training mode, and other useful features, such as displaying plots that show you your progress and whether you are reaching your daily training goal, and the ability to save searches, a la Thunderbird saved filters. It is written in Python and oldschool tkinter with custom widgets for a somewhat more modern and capable feel. It is very configurable. Though currently configuring it means touching a JSON file, as I have not yet bothered writing GUI for that.<p>I am mostly developing this for myself, to have the perfect tool for me, but I dare say, that I have not seen anything comparable and that I let my 10y+ experience in learning Chinese influence my design decisions. Oh, and it is free &#x2F;libre software of course (AGPL). It comes with an ever improving vocabulary file that has tons of metadata about words, their usage, how to memorize them, etc. under ODbL (open database license).<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;ZelphirKaltstahl&#x2F;xiaolong-dictionary\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;ZelphirKaltstahl&#x2F;xiaolong-dictionary</a>",
      "When I was living in Taiwan, one of the ways I forced myself to remember to pronounce the tones distinctly was by waving my hand in front of me, tracing the arc of each character’s tone.<p>It helped a lot even if I did look like an insane expat conducting an invisible orchestra.<p>One more thing: there&#x27;s quite a bit of variation in how regional accents in the mainland can affect tonal pronunciation. It might be worth reaching to some native speakers to give you some baseline figures.",
      "This is very cool, but from one Mandarin learner to another I’d caution against relying too heavily on any external feedback mechanism for improving your pronunciation.<p>If you can’t easily hear your pronunciation mistakes so clearly it hurts, consider putting more energy into training your ear. Adult language learners usually have brains that have become resistant to, but not incapable of, changing the parts of the brain responsible for phoneme recognition. The neuroplasticity is still there but it needs some nudging with focused exercises that make it clear to your brain exactly what the problem is. Minimal pair recognition drills, for example, are a great place to start.<p>It’s not the most fun task, but it’s worth it. You will tighten the pronunciation practice feedback loop much more than is possible with external feedback, so a better accent is the most obvious benefit. But beyond that, it will make a night and day difference for your listening comprehension. And that will get you access to more interesting learning materials sooner. Which hopefully increases your enjoyment and hence your time on task. Plus, more accurate and automatic phoneme recognition leaves more neurological resources free for processing other aspects of your input materials. So it may even help speed things like vocabulary and grammar acquisition.",
      "Well, it would work only when I speak word by word, not as a sentence or in a normal speed for daily conversations. The model thinks I was making mistakes when I speak casually (as a native Chinese speaker, I had Mandarin 2A certification, which is required for teachers or other occupations that requires a very high degree of Mandarin accuracy). You wouldn’t really notice it but language pronunciations is very different between causal and formal speech…"

      "This is one of the more true and balanced articles.<p>On the verification loop: I think there’s so much potential here. AI is pretty good at autonomously working on tasks that have a well defined and easy to process verification hook.<p>A lot of software tasks are “migrate X to Y” and this is a perfect job for AI.<p>The workflow is generally straightforward - map the old thing to the new thing and verify that the new thing works the same way. Most of this can be automated using AI.<p>Wanna migrate codebase from C to Rust? I definitely think it should be possible autonomously if the code base is small enough. You do have to ask the AI to intelligently come up with extensive way to verify that they work the same. Maybe UI check, sample input and output check on API and functionality check.",

The &quot;step behind the bleeding edge&quot; philosophy resonates deeply - especially the security concerns around the AI gold rush mentality.

The WASM binary is proprietary—you can use it with this package but can&#x27;t extract or redistribute it separately.",
      "Sure, but every tool that you provide access to, is a potential escape hatch from the sandbox.  It&#x27;s safer to run everything inside the sandbox, including the called tools.",
      "Why not just put the agent in a VM?",

Very interesting!",
      "I really like the capability enforcement model, it&#x27;s a great concept. One thing this discussion is missing though is the ecosystem layer. Sandboxing solves execution safety, but there&#x27;s a parallel problem: how do agents discover and compose tools portably across frameworks? Right now every framework has its own tool format and registry (or none at all). WASM&#x27;s component model actually solves this — you get typed interfaces (WIT), language interop, and composability for free. I&#x27;ve been building a registry and runtime (also based on wasmtime!) for this: components written in any language, published to a shared registry, runnable locally or in the cloud. Sandboxes like amla-sandbox could be a consumer of these components. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asterai.io&#x2F;why\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asterai.io&#x2F;why</a>",

I&#x27;m incredibly happy to see more people joining on the quest!",
      "Cool to see more projects in this space! I think Wasm is a great way to do secure sandboxing here. How does Amla handle commands like grep&#x2F;jq&#x2F;curl etc which make AI agents so effective at bash but require recompilation to WASI (which is kinda impractical for so many projects)?<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a couple of things which take a very similar approach, with what seem to be some different tradeoffs:<p>- eryx [1], which uses a WASI build of CPython to provide a true Python sandbox (similar to componentize-py but supports some form of &#x27;dynamic linking&#x27; with either pure Python packages or WASI-compiled native wheels)\n- conch [2], which embeds the `brush` Rust reimplementation of Bash to provide a similar bash sandbox. This is where I&#x27;ve been struggling with figuring out the best way to do subcommands, right now they just have to be rewritten and compiled in but I&#x27;d like to find a way to dynamically link them in similar to the Python package approach...<p>One other note, WASI&#x27;s VFS support has been great, I just wish there was more progress on `wasi-tls`, it&#x27;s tricky to get network access working otherwise...<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eryx-org&#x2F;eryx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eryx-org&#x2F;eryx</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sd2k&#x2F;conch\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sd2k&#x2F;conch</a>",
      "We went down the WASM sandboxing rabbit hole at Gobii when building our agent infra. The pitch is appealing until you realize the tradeoff: you either accept a limited environment with reimplemented tools, or you emulate your way back to a full Linux system (like agentvm does at 173MB) and wonder why you didn&#x27;t just start with gvisor or Firecracker.<p>We landed on gvisor in k8s. Our agents run headless Chromium for browser automation, ffmpeg for media processing, yt-dlp, ripgrep, fzf - real tools that would be a nightmare to port or reimplement.

      "I think this is a backwards approach, especially for children.<p>Gen AI is magical, it makes stuff appear out of thin air!<p>And it&#x27;s limited, everything it makes kinda looks the same<p>And it&#x27;s forgetful, it doesn&#x27;t remember what it just did<p>And it&#x27;s dangerous! It can make things that never happened<p>Starting with theory might be the simplest way to explain, but it leaves out the hook. Why should they care?",
      "I couldn’t find it easily, what age range is this intended for? The images make it seem elementary-school-ish, but I’m not sure if elementary school kids have the foundations for interpreting scatterplots, let alone scatterplots with logarithmic axes. I’ve been out of education for a while though, so maybe I’m misremembering.",
      "The &quot;learning through making&quot; approach is really good. When I&#x27;ve explained LLMs to non-technical people, the breakthrough moment is usually when they see temperature in action. High temperature = creative but chaotic, low temperature = predictable but boring. You can&#x27;t just describe that.<p>What I&#x27;d add: the lesson about hallucinations should come early, not just in the RAG module. Kids (and adults) need to internalize &quot;confident-sounding doesn&#x27;t mean correct&quot; before they get too comfortable. The gap between fluency and accuracy is the thing that trips everyone up.",
      "Which module introduces students to some of the ethical and environmental aspects of using GenAI?",
      "This is excellent intuition to have for how LLMs work, as well as understanding the implications of living in an LLM-powered world. Just as useful to adults as children.",
      "The vast majority of schools in North America don&#x27;t allow teachers or students to download and run software on school computers (let alone AI models), so I don&#x27;t entirely know who the audience is for this. I suppose home users? Maybe it&#x27;s different in the UK.",
      "This is great and has lots of practical stuff.<p>Some of the takeaways feel over-reliant on implementation details that don’t capture intent. E.g. something like “the LLM is just trying to predict the next word” sort of has the explanatory power of “your computer works because it’s just using binary”—like yeah, sure, practically speaking yes—but that’s just the most efficient way to lay out their respective architectures and could conceivably be changed from under you.<p>I wonder if something like neural style transfer would work as a prelude. It helps me. Don’t know how you’d introduce it, but with NST you have two objectives—content loss and style loss—and can see pretty quickly visually how the model balances between the two and where it fails.<p>The bigger picture here is that people came up with a bunch of desirable properties they wanted to see and a way to automatically fulfill <i>some</i> of them <i>some</i> of the time by looking at lots of examples, and it’s why you get a text box that can write like Shakespeare but can’t tell you whether your grandma will be okay after she went to the hospital an hour ago.",
      "I wonder how utterly broken the next generation will be, having to grow up with all this stuff.<p>Us millennials didn’t do so great with native access to the internet, zoomers got wrecked growing up with social media. . . It’s rough."

      "Related: GMail has an option to disable loading images by default. Which helps me escape tracker pixels and also know if a &quot;human-like&quot; email still has a tracking pixel or not.",
      "OK, but who uses email anymore for personal communication?<p>At least for most people in my circle, family is using a social media platform or iMessages. And work is using Teams or Slack or whatever.<p>Work email is basically useless at this point. I&#x27;m completely drowning in various Teams chats created specifically for each &quot;thread&quot; of conversation, with just enough people to make it unique. Or inversely, created with too many people and all conversation is just lost to infinite scroll and walls of text.<p>I&#x27;d pine for a return to email. But no one uses it anymore. Only companies trying to get my attention and a few important forwards for tax receipts. I think email is dead.",

Good on you.",

      "Cool app. It takes a lot of courage to share here, so well done. I’d definitely highlight a bit more prominently what languages it supports though.\n The interface is very “Claude” so I’d be keen to hear about:<p>- How did you go about developing this?<p>- Was the entire thing vibe coded or just part of it? No shade either way, just curious.<p>- How long did it take?<p>- What were some of the harder hurdles to overcome?<p>- Given the use of AI, what’s your approach to security of your users data?

No matter what I put in the system instructions it always responds with the same old walls of text and same old it&#x27;s x not y etc.<p>Does this one have a prompt that actually takes care of this problem?  Does anyone have some nice prompts that make the ai actually useful as a practice partner?",
      "Crazy that when I search for this in the App Store on my phone, it first shows me results for Talbots, and then when I click &quot;show results for Talkbits&quot; it shows me a bunch of other apps. I scrolled through a bunch but then gave up and copied&#x2F;pasted the URL. Ridiculous!",
      "I&#x27;m surprised that an app like this can be rated are 4+, since any open web browser has to be adult-only. I would think that an app like this, unless it has very secure guardrails.<p>How does Apple deal with rating apps that tie into LLMs?",
      "Without using headphones, the mic picks the AI speech, meaning it ends up in a discussion loop with itself",
      "I really love this concept for an app. Downloading and getting going was a breeze.<p>That said, I’m finding some latency issues when I respond. I’ll say something in Spanish, hit the red button, and none of the text I sent appears.<p>Then I’ll hit the red button again to start talking but before I do the assistant responds to my response and the words I spoke show up<p>Some of the back and forth is showing up out of order.<p>Also, error messages are in Spanish, and my Spanish isn’t good enough to read them so I’m not sure what to do<p>Again, love this concept and would love to have an ai assistant I can have daily conversations with to start sharp<p>Would possibly be nice to prime the ai before the convo saying “I’d like to talk about x” in English<p>Keep going! I’ll keep playing with it",
      "so, from a PT-PT perspective, I guess I can understand, the clanker begins in PT-BR. After I instruct it to switch to PT-PT, it starts mixing formal and informal phrase constructions (think like the German Du and Sie forms) which is odd but then becomes really jarring with the accent&#x2F;tone which is sounds mechanical and robotic unlike the uncanny valley of gemini or openAI models. Anyways, I like the app and can imagine interesting use cases while abroad!"

I haven&#x27;t seen it yet, but if it happens, I&#x27;ll know.<p>So it&#x27;s really just a technical question. Not a philosophical one.",
      "I find it interesting how in the essay Sanderson implies he doesn’t take issue with AI as a tool. You can use it to search in a more advanced way, or to summarise meeting minutes.<p>He in essence claims there is some intangible attribute of a work that defines it as art or not depending on both the person who made it and the process they went through.<p>It does seem like a slightly romantic notion, since for any given item you can’t know if it’s art or not just by looking at it, which seems a bit odd. But then again, I suppose there’s a reason people pay for guided tours at museums so they can learn about the history and background of a work.<p>Side note: the title is editorialised; it should be “The Hidden Cost of AI Art: Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s Keynote”"
