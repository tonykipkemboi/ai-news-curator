      "Private surveillance is so much more scary than regular government surveillance because they have every incentive to invent new ways of surveilling you that they then try to sell to governments, or private actors who want to influence the world. It&#x27;s like classic government surveillance but every company you interacted with and every app you use may at some point turn on you and use your data against you, just because someone realized &quot;hey, I bet we can sell this data&quot;<p>We are really seeing the fears of data collection from the 2000s and 2010s come to fruition as privatized surveillance now.

That seems like a pretty slam shut case if there were any mechanism to investigate and prosecute it.",
      "How are Palantir so effective?<p>From a cynical British perspective, when I think of government departments and civil servants. I think inefficiency, data siloing, politics and lack of communication between departments and also internally not communicating between teams.

The article references Medicaid data, but everyone that has access to Medicaid is legally present in the country. They have to be to qualify. Some possiblities:<p>* They are going after people legally here on temporary visas such as SIV that give them access to medicaid<p>* They are going after people that are not on medicaid and have no insurance but received care (either emergency care or charity care) at a hospital or clinic that takes medicaid (I don’t know if hospitals capture this information for CMS).<p>* ?",

      "I worry about the &quot;brain atrophy&quot; part, as I&#x27;ve felt this too. And not just atrophy, but even moreso I think it&#x27;s evolving into &quot;complacency&quot;.<p>Like there have been multiple times now where I wanted the code to look a certain way, but it kept pulling back to the way it wanted to do things. Like if I had stated certain design goals recently it would adhere to them, but after a few iterations it would forget again and go back to its original approach, or mix the two, or whatever. Eventually it was easier just to quit fighting it and let it do things the way it wanted.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen is that after the initial dopamine rush of being able to do things that would have taken much longer manually, a few iterations of this kind of interaction has slowly led to a disillusionment of the whole project, as AI keeps pushing it in a direction I didn&#x27;t want.<p>I think this is especially true if you&#x27;re trying to experiment with new approaches to things. LLMs are, by definition, biased by what was in their training data. You can shock them out of it momentarily, whish is awesome for a few rounds, but over time the gravitational pull of what&#x27;s already in their latent space becomes inescapable. (I picture it as working like a giant Sierpinski triangle).<p>I want to say the end result is very akin to doom scrolling. Doom tabbing?

      "I retired from paid sw dev work in 2020 when COVID arrived. \nI’ve worked on my small projects since with all development by hand. I’d followed the rise of AI, but not used it. \nLate last year I started a project that included reverse engineering some firmware that runs on an Intel 8096 based embedded processor. I’d never worked on that processor before. There are tools available, but they cost many $. So, I started to think about a simple disassembler. \n2 weeks ago we decided to try Claude to see what it could do. We now have a disassembler, assembler and a partially working emulator. No doubt there are bugs and missing features and the code is a bit messy, but boy has it sped up the work.\nOne thing did occur to me. Vendors of small utilities could be in trouble. For example I needed to cut out some pages from a pdf. I could have found a tool online(I’m sure there are several), write one myself. However, Claude quickly performed the task.",
      "&gt; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.<p>I’ve always said I’m a builder even though I’ve also enjoyed programming (but for an outcome, never for the sake of the code)<p>This perfectly sums up what I’ve been observing between people like me (builders) who are ecstatic about this new world and programmers who talk about the craft of programming, sometimes butting heads.<p>One viewpoint isn’t necessarily more valid, just a difference of wiring.",
      "I would agree that OAIs GPT-5 family of models is a phase change over GPT-4.<p>In the ChatGPT product this is not immediately obvious and many people would strongly argue their preference for 4. However, once you introduce several complex tools and make tool calling mandatory, the difference becomes stark.<p>I&#x27;ve got an agent loop that will fail nearly every time on GPT-4. It works sometimes, but definitely not enough to go to production. GPT-5 with reasoning set to minimal works 100% of the time. $200 worth of tokens and it still hasn&#x27;t failed to select the proper sequence of tools. It sometimes gets the arguments to the tools incorrect, but it&#x27;s always holding the right ones now.<p>I was very skeptical based upon prior experience but flipping between the models makes it clear there has been recent stepwise progress.<p>I&#x27;ll probably be $500 deep in tokens before the end of the month. I could barely go $20 before I called bullshit on this stuff last time.",

They may outperform us simply because they don&#x27;t ever get tired and give up.<p>Full quote for context:<p>Tenacity. It&#x27;s so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It&#x27;s a &quot;feel the AGI&quot; moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later.

By changing practices and methods, you get acceleration and improvement. That creates &quot;high-performing teams&quot;, which is the team form of a 10x engineer. Whether or not you believe in &#x27;10x engineers&#x27;, a high-performing team is real. You really can make your team deploy faster, with fewer bugs. You have to change how you all work to accomplish it, though.<p>To get good at using AI for coding, you have to do the same thing: continuous improvement, changing workflows, different designs, development of trust through automation and validation. Just like DevOps, this requires learning brand new concepts, and changing how a whole team works. This didn&#x27;t get adopted widely with DevOps because nobody wanted to learn new things or change how they work. So it&#x27;s possible people won&#x27;t adapt to the &quot;better&quot; way of using AI for coding, even if it would produce a 10x result.<p>If we want this new way of working to stick, it&#x27;s going to require education, and a change of engineering culture.",

      "The press release (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asml.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2026&#x2F;strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asml.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2026&#x2F;strengtheni...</a>) seems remarkably to the point, for CEO press release standards.<p>I&#x27;m impressed by their ambition to fire <i>1700 managers</i>(!) That&#x27;s a lot of managers! I interviewed with ASML a decade and a half ago and while there was plenty to complain about (eg their tens of millions of lines of absolutely unmaintainable C code), I didn&#x27;t feel at the time feel like it was a very top-heavy organization. It was <i>very</i> engineer-y, and I loved that about them. This press release (when taken at face value) suggests that this has changed a lot over time and they&#x27;re now trying to correct it.<p>I gotta say, if true and not code for general &quot;cheese slicer&quot; cost cutting, I think that this is rather ballsy. Philips (which ASML spun out of) famously never did anything of the sort and gradually cramped into an extremely management-heavy organization where most people just write reports for other people with scary few people actually moving the needle. I think it&#x27;s cool that ASML has identified that they&#x27;re risking becoming like Philips and trying to do something about it, even if the method seems rather crude. I think the risk is real. ASML&#x27;s fast-moving culture formed in a mad multi-decade survival-crunch, but they&#x27;ve been a near-monopolist for a while now and that means those pressures are long gone.",
      "I’m generally supportive of the tech industry’s move to rid itself of too many mangers.<p>Most managers are no longer technical, and just create bloated middle layers that slow everyone else down.<p>The only managers that are decent are the ones that have kept their technical skills sharp. Most others just seem to be able to say “my team will follow-up” and “my team will look into this” and are beyond useless. Few are shedding a tear at cleaning that up.",
      "It&#x27;s insane to me how the manager culture is. Somehow going from an engineer to a manager is a &quot;promotion&quot;?<p>No, they are equals. Just different people doing different kinds of jobs. There should be two tracks and people should be able to choose. If engineers feel they have to become managers to grow their careers, all you are getting will just be unhappy engineers and bad managers.",
      "&gt; ASML also announced a new share buyback programme of up to €12 billion, to be executed by 31 December 2028.<p>Oh boy. This fills me with dread. I&#x27;ve never seen a company that starts doing buybacks not become a financialized hollow shell within a decade. Being an irreplaceable monopoly on the commanding heights of the digital economy makes this even worse.",
      "I was completely caught off-guard, because initially I read the headline as &quot;ASMR of firing 1,700 people, mostly managers&quot; which I would listen to",
      "Guys, is the current narrative that, due to AI, pure engineering is gone and we’re all supposed to be “managers”, or is it the other way around? I kinda lost the plot here.",
      "Can someone explain, why this is done?\nI get a feeling, it&#x27;s normally done when a company is in trouble or will soon? But they should have more money than ever.<p>They say it is to focus on innovation, but if you are a smart young person in NL, would you want to work where they just fired 1700 people? And if you already work there and are a top player it is a good time to rethink?\nA company I know wanted to focus, instead of firing, they sold the parts of the company they felt did not fit their future vision for money.",
      "Apologies for the Dutch source, but I couldn’t find any source in English yet.<p>“ ASML plans to eliminate approximately 3,000 of its 4,500 management positions in engineering. The expectation is that approximately 1,400 people will be able to move into new engineering roles.”",
      "&gt; Engineers in particular have expressed their desire to focus their time on engineering, without being hampered by slow process flows [1]<p>I wonder what correlation will exist between the set of people who end up leaving the company, and the set of people responsible for setting up those &quot;slow process flows&quot; in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asml.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2026&#x2F;strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asml.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2026&#x2F;strengtheni...</a>",
      "This is <i>fascinating</i>. Whenever I heard about matrix management it always seemed a bit weird that you have essentially two organisational structures in tension with each other - the function group lead is always going to be in tension with the product managers over how their products are resourced. I guess an obvious failure mode is you end up just stripping on direction out which is what they&#x27;re doing here. One thing that goes unsaid in these situations is often the decision making for how that&#x27;s done is quite political."

      "The rendering is pretty chaotic when I tried it- not that far off from just the text in the html tags, in some size, color, and placement on the screen. This sounds like unfairness, but there is some motte-and-bailey where if you claim to be a browser, I get to evaluate on stuff like links being consistently blue and underlined ( as is, they are sometimes blue and sometimes underlined, without a clear pattern- if they were never formatted differently from standard text, I would just buy this as a feature not implemented yet). It may be that some of the rendering is not supported on windows- the back button certainly isn&#x27;t. I guess if I want to make my criticism actually legitimate I should make a &quot;one human and no agent browser&quot; post that just regexes out stuff that looks like content and formats it at random.

This is similar to countless graphical toolkits that have been written since the 70s.<p>I know Servo has a &quot;no AI contribution&quot; policy, but I still would be more impressed by a Servo fork that gets missing APIs implemented by an AI, with WPT tests passing etc. It&#x27;s a lot less marketable I guess. Go add something like WebTransport for instance, it&#x27;s a recent API so the spec should be properly written and there&#x27;s a good test suite.",

Rather, I want to get a perspective on what kind of expertise went into the guidance (without having to read all the guidance and be familiar with browser implementation myself). &quot;How long this would have taken the author&quot; seems like one possible proxy for &quot;how much pre-existing experience went into this agent&#x27;s guidance&quot;.",
      "This post is far more interesting than many others on the same subject, not because of what is built but because of how it it is built. There is a ton of noise on this subject and most of it seems to focus on the thing - or even on the author - rather than on the process, the constraints and the outcome.",
      "Impressive work.<p>I wonder if you&#x27;ve looked into what it would take to implement accessibility while maintaining your no-Rust-dependencies rule. On Windows and macOS, it&#x27;s straightforward enough to implement UI Automation and the Cocoa NSAccessibility protocols respectively. On Unix&#x2F;X11, as I see it, your options are:<p>1. Implement AT-SPI with a new from-scratch D-Bus implementation.<p>2. Implement AT-SPI with one of the D-Bus C libraries (GLib, libdbus, or sdbus).<p>3. Use GTK, or maybe Qt.",
      "It&#x27;s interesting to think that—independently of what you think of Cursor&#x27;s browser implementation being truly &quot;from scratch&quot; or not—the fact that people are implementing browsers from scratch with agents happened because of Cursor&#x27;s post. In other words, in a twisted and funny way, <i>this</i> browser exists <i>because</i> of Cursor&#x27;s agent.<p>This is how we should be thinking about AI safety!"

There&#x27;s so much abandonware out there, either as full apps&#x2F;servers or libraries. These can&#x27;t ever really be patched. Previously these weren&#x27;t really worth spending effort on - might have a few thousand targets of questionable value.<p>Now you can spin up potentially thousands of exploits against thousands of long tail services. In aggregate this is millions of targets.<p>And even if this case didn&#x27;t exist it&#x27;s going to be difficult to patch systems quickly enough. Imagine an adversary that can drip feed zero days against targets.<p>Not really sure how this can be solved. I guess you&#x27;d hope that the good guys can do some sort of mega patch against software quicker than bad actors.<p>But really as the npm debacle showed the industry is not in a good place when it comes to timely secure software delivery even without millions of potential new zero days flying around.",

Seems kinda believable but also ....... terrifying? What if someone is calling the AESNI codepath directly for reasons?<p>Here&#x27;s the data about that one:<p>&quot;Issue summary: When using the low-level OCB API directly with AES-NI or\nother hardware-accelerated code paths, inputs whose length is not a multiple\nof 16 bytes can leave the final partial block unencrypted and unauthenticated.<p>Impact summary: The trailing 1-15 bytes of a message may be exposed in\ncleartext on encryption and are not covered by the authentication tag,\nallowing an attacker to read or tamper with those bytes without detection.&quot;",

It had chip-specific speedups from the days of the Intel 486.<p>I was part of a body which funded work to include some stuff in the code, and the way you take something like X509 and incorperate a new ASN.1 structure inside the code, to be validated against conformance requirements (so not just signing blindly over the bitstream, but understanding the ASN.1 and validating it has certain properties about what it says, like not overlapping assertions of numeric ranges encoded in it) is to invoke callouts from deep down, to perform tasks and then return state. You basically seem to have to do about a 5 layer deep callout and return. It&#x27;s a massive wedding cake of dependency on itself, it personifies the xkcd diagram of &quot;...depends on &lt;small thing&gt;&quot; risks.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised people continue to find flaws.

      "The limiting factor at work isn&#x27;t writing code anymore. It&#x27;s deciding what to build and catching when things go sideways.<p>We&#x27;ve been running agent workflows for a while now. The pattern that works: treat agents like junior team members. Clear scope, explicit success criteria, checkpoints to review output. The skills that matter are the same ones that make someone a good manager of people.<p>pglevy is right that many managers aren&#x27;t good at this. But that&#x27;s always been true. The difference now is that the feedback loop is faster. Bad delegation to an agent fails in minutes, not weeks. You learn quickly whether your instructions were clear.<p>The uncomfortable part: if your value was being the person who could grind through tedious work, that&#x27;s no longer a moat. Orchestration and judgment are what&#x27;s left.",
      "&gt; And there was something else: most early startups need to pivot, changing direction as they learn more about what the market wants and what is technically possible. By lowering the costs of pivoting, it was much easier to explore the possibilities without being locked in or even explore multiple startups at once: you just tell the AI what you want.<p>In my experience so far, AI prototyping has been a powerful force for breaking analysis paralysis.<p>In the last 10 years of my career, the slow execution speed at different companies wasn&#x27;t due to slow code writing. It was due to management excesses trying to drive consensus and de-risk ideas before the developers were even allowed to write the code. Let&#x27;s circle back and drive consensus in a weekly meeting with the stakeholders to get alignment on the KPIs for the design doc that goes through the approval and sign off process first.<p>Developers would then read the ream and realize that perfection was expected from their output, too, so development processes grew to be long and careful to avoid accidents. I landed on a couple teams where even small changes required meetings to discuss it, multiple rounds of review, and a lot of grandstanding before we were allowed to proceed.<p>Then AI comes along and makes it cheap to prototype something. If it breaks or it&#x27;s the wrong thing, nobody feels like they&#x27;re in trouble because we all agree it was a prototype and the AI wrote it. We can cycle through prototypes faster because it&#x27;s happening outside of this messy human reputation-review-grandstanding loop that has become the norm.<p>Instead of months of meetings, we can have an LLM generate a UI and a backend with fake data and say &quot;This is what I want to build, and this is what it will do&quot;. It&#x27;s a hundred times more efficient than trying to describe it to a dozen people in 1-hour timeslots in between all of their other meetings for 12 weeks in a row.<p>The dark side of this same coin is when teams try to rely on the AI to write the real code, too, and then blame the AI when something goes wrong. You have to draw a very clear line between AI-driven prototyping and developer-driven code that developers must own. I think this article misses the mark on that by framing everything as a decision to DIY or delegate to AI. The real AI-assisted successes I see have developers driving with AI as an assistant on the side, not the other way around. I could see how an MBA class could come to believe that AI is going to do the jobs instead of developers, though, as it&#x27;s easy to look at these rapid LLM prototypes and think that production ready code is just a few prompts away.",
      "I thought I had a great startup idea. It was niche, but a solid global market. It was unique. There was a genuine pain point being solved. My MVP solved it. The pricing worked, the tiers were sound.<p>At least ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude told me it was. I did so many rounds of each one evaluating the other, trying to poke holes etc. Reviewing the idea and the &quot;research&quot;, the reasoning. Plugging the gaps.<p>Then I started talking to real people about their problems in this space to see if this was one of them. Nope, not really. It kinda was, but not often enough to pay for a dedicated service, and not enough of a pain to move on from free workarounds.<p>Beware of AI reviewing AI. Always talk to real people to validate.",
      "The &quot;management as superpower&quot; framing assumes people thoughtfully evaluate AI output. In practice, most users either review everything (slow, defeats the speed benefit) or review almost nothing (fast, but you&#x27;re trusting the AI entirely). The MBAs who did well probably had domain expertise to spot wrong answers quickly, that&#x27;s the actual superpower, not generic &quot;management skill",
      "When thinking about automation people overindex on their current class biases. For 20 years we heard that robots were going to take over the “burger flipper” jobs. Why was it so easy to think that robots could replace fast food workers? Because they were the lowest rung on the career ladder, so it felt natural that they would be the first ones to get replaced.<p>Similarly, it’s easy to think that the lowly peons in the engineering world are going to get replaced and we’ll all be doing the job of directors and CEOs in the future, but that doesn’t really make sense to me.<p>Being able to whip your army of AI employees 3% better than your competitor doesn’t (usually) give any lasting advantage.<p>What does give an advantage is: specialized deep knowledge, building relationships and trust with users and customers, and having a good sense of design&#x2F;ux&#x2F;etc.<p>Like maybe that’s some of the job of a manager&#x2F;director&#x2F;CEO, but not anyone that I’ve worked with.",
      "this is going to be the ultimate rug pull, for lack of a better expression. without actually gaining real skills, how are people relying on AI going to cope when it is unavailable or taken away or becomes too expensive? there&#x27;s people advocating for UBI but why would you have incentive to donate income to incompetent unproductive people.",
      "&gt; I think many people have the skills they need, or can learn them, in order to work with AI agents - they are management 101 skills.<p>I like his thinking but many professional managers are not good at management. So I&#x27;m not sure about the assumption that &quot;many people&quot; can easily pick this up.",

      "I find it interesting, in the last couple of years Apple started to push towards higher RAM minimums in their phones - largely associated with the roll out of Apple Intelligence. But now it&#x27;s looking a lot like Apple Intelligence will never be delivered and by the time they roll something out it&#x27;ll be Gemini backed. So I wonder if that was kind of a waste and now they&#x27;re going to get hit double for it with the sky-rocketing RAM prices. Presumably on-device inference is largely dead at this point. I can&#x27;t imagine Apple releasing a device that goes backwards on RAM though.",

      "Technical blogs from infrastructure companies used to serve two purposes: demonstrate expertise and build trust. When the posts start overpromising, you lose both.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about this specific implementation to say whether &quot;implemented Matrix&quot; is accurate or marketing stretch. But the pattern of &quot;we did X&quot; blog posts that turn out to be &quot;we did a demo of part of X&quot; is getting tiresome across the industry.<p>The fix is boring: just be precise about what you built. &quot;We prototyped a Matrix homeserver on Workers with these limitations&quot; is less exciting but doesn&#x27;t erode trust.",
      "My charitable read on this is that an individual vibe-coded both the post and repository and was able to publish to the Cloudflare blog without it actually being reviewed or vetted. They also are not an engineer and when the agent hallucinated “I have built and tested this and it is production grade,” they took it at face value.<p>You can tell since the code is in a public repository and not Cloudflare’s, which IMO is the big giveaway that this is a lesson for Cloudflare in having appropriate review processes for public comms and for the individual to avoid making claims they cannot substantiate or verify independently.",
      "I&#x27;d love to see a root cause analysis post by Cloudflare for this one. The ones they do after outages are always interesting to read. \nHow did this make it into the blog? What is the review process for these posts and what failed this time? What measures will be taken to restore Cloudflare blog&#x27;s reputation?",
      "I found the source code Jade was referring to, and it looks like the author just noticed this thread: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nkuntz1934&#x2F;matrix-workers&#x2F;commit&#x2F;0823b47c263c5fe0ad407c18614437bbad39e1c6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nkuntz1934&#x2F;matrix-workers&#x2F;commit&#x2F;0823b47c...</a>",

      "So the original post had this added to the top:<p>&gt; <i>This post was updated at 11:15 a.m. Pacific time to clarify that the use case described here is a proof of concept. Some sections have been updated for clarity.</i><p>But then the bottom still says:<p>&gt; <i>Our team is using Matrix on Workers, handling real encrypted communications. It is fast, it is cheap, and it is arguably one of the most secure ways to deploy a homeserver today.</i><p>Which one is it?",
      "It is worrying to see a major vendor release code that does not actually work just to sell a new product. When companies pretend that complex engineering is easy it makes it very hard for the rest of us to explain why building safe software takes time. This kind of behavior erodes the trust that we place in their platform.",
      "<p><pre><code>    5 - A production-grade Matrix homeserver [...]\n    5 + This is a proof of concept Matrix homeserver [...]\n</code></pre>\nThis whole thing in a nutshell. Bold and sad to see this. Cloudflare has&#x2F;had such outstanding posts that I really like&#x2F;ed to read.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nkuntz1934&#x2F;matrix-workers&#x2F;commit&#x2F;fd412f41f98c0f3f360f5c4034443ef80680de49\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nkuntz1934&#x2F;matrix-workers&#x2F;commit&#x2F;fd412f41...</a>",

      "Bloody hell that&#x27;s embarrassing, for both Cloudflare and the blog author. Did he not have anyone review it before publishing?<p>So many failures coming out of Cloudflare these days, feels like they peaked a while ago and are slowly declining into incompetence."

      "Lmao I called it the day of the tragedy. These flying deathtraps should have been chopped up into beer cans 15 years ago. There is a reason they have not flown people commercially—at all—for over a decade. Most airlines dumped them in the 90s. The safety record for this aircraft is insane, with a nasty habit of flipping over onto its back if you botched the landing ever so slightly. They tried to push every cent out of these birds, like your neighbor who still drives a Pontiac Fiero to work because it&#x27;s a &quot;perfectly good car&quot;.",
