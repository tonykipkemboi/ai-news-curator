      "As Fairphone owner I have become somewhat sceptical of their repairability claim.<p>Mine fell on its side on some pebble stones. The power-button, unprotected by the case, got scratched. The button doubles as a fingerprint reader, which ceased working due to the scratch. At first, I thought &quot;no worries, this phone is friendly to those who want to repair it.&quot;<p>It turns out, this part is not available for replacement. I think this is an oversight; just like the screen, it is an outward facing part, hence, bound to be damaged for some.<p>Then, I brought it to my local repair shop. The owner had to tell me that they cannot repair Fairphone&#x27;s, and that, for him, it is one of the worst companies to deal with. They try to centralise all repairs in their own repair center. Which means sending the phone -- which I need -- away for 2 weeks; paying a fee for diagnosis, an unknown cost for repair, and the hassle of a flashed phone. I already know what&#x27;s broken, I just want the part.<p>I feel this is a real shame, as I am fully supportive of the stated aims of the company, and I want the product to be good.<p>[Aside: suggestions on how to deal with a scratched fingerprint reader are most welcome. E.g. can the scatch be re-painted? The phone thinks the reader is there, but it doesn&#x27;t register any touch. ]",
      "I have a friend who bought a fair phone with a view to being able to replace its modular parts. Four years later and the model had been discontinued, so he had to buy a new Fairphone.<p>Would it more economical and sustainable to buy a second hand &#x2F; reconditioned feature phone from Samsung?",
      "The easily replacable parts feature sounds like it&#x27;d work great in a university context. The uni&#x27;s service desk could stock up on replacement parts and fix the phones right there instead of having to send it in for repairs.",
      "Seeing news like this, I wonder whether there is a market for an OSS Android and&#x2F;or Linux distribution that provides the management comfort of Chromebooks without being tied to Google, Apple or Microsoft. A little like Keycloak but one layer higher.",
      "Posting from an FP4 with slashyslash! (&#x2F;e&#x2F;)<p>Good move from a service perspective, repairs while you wait instead of backing up, transfer to new phone, sending the old one in for service, yada yada yada. Also great for Fairphone&#x27;s growth to have a stable business partner.",
      "Fairphones are awesome, and they even come with a de-googled version of android.  Also: Made in Holland!",
      "They’re hardly pioneers; my wife’s employer switched from Apple to Fairphone as the pre-selected option a few years ago. They have about 10k employees.",
      "Tangential to the article but I’m on year 6 of waiting for the alternative smartphone market to offer what I’m actually looking for and here seems as good a place as any to complain about it:<p>I just want a screen with a headphone jack and a web browser on a device that isn’t serviced by Apple or Google.<p>I don’t even care about having the battery being removable. It doesn’t even have to be able to make phone calls.<p>I’m getting ready to go back to a dumbphone and digital camera because no one is making what I’m looking for, and it sort of seems like they never will.",

      "I always love reading about Nepal. I&#x27;ve been a handful of times, for various short climbs and for some far longer 30+ day expeditions.<p>If you&#x27;re reading this and need a short escape from life, I really recommend looking into doing the trek to EBC. It&#x27;s extremely accessible (and cheap), and I&#x27;ve personally seen people as young as 8 y&#x2F;o and as old as 80 y&#x2F;o doing it and having the time of their lives.<p>I&#x27;ve been all over the world. Antarctica, climbing in Pakistan, trekking through the Middle East... Nepal was one of my first adventures and remains one of my favourites.<p>To stay on topic... Teahouses can be found along every route through the mountains. Most of my fond memories are in teahouses, where you get to sit, have a black tea, and reflect on just how beautiful the people (and the mountains) are. It&#x27;s also a great opportunity to meet people from other cultures. I&#x27;ll always remember the Russian&#x27;s who bought me a beer after climbing Island Peak, the cards I played with some kids in Samagaun... I could go on.<p>Go visit Nepal!",
      "I trekked to the summit of Mera Peak some 25 years ago. We slept in tents every night. There were very few, if any, teahouses between Lukla and the summit back then. I guess it is good that more Nepalis are making a living from trekkers with their tea houses.<p>It was an incredible experience, but not for the faint-hearted. A couple of people in our group were unlucky and had serious issues (oedema and an aneurism) and were too high for helicopter evacuation, but they both survived. If you want to do something like this, go with a reputable company (such as KE Experience in the UK).",

      "I never stopped developing but I find myself taking on a lot more side projects than I used to. The cost for doing those just dropped significantly. This enables me to prototype and pursue things that I previously wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>I&#x27;m also now dealing with things that previously would have taken me too long to deal with. For example, I&#x27;m actually making a dent in the amount of technical debt I have to deal with. The type of things where previously I maybe wouldn&#x27;t have taken a week out of my schedule to deal with something that was annoying me. A lot of tedious things that would take me hours&#x2F;days now can get done in a few prompts. With my bigger projects, I still do most stuff manually. But that&#x27;s probably going to change over the next months&#x2F;year.<p>I&#x27;m mainly using codex. I know a lot of people seem to prefer Claude Code. But I&#x27;ve been a happy ChatGPT Plus user for a while and codex is included with that and seems to do the job. Amazing value for 20$&#x2F;month. I&#x27;ve had to buy extra credit once now.<p>The flip side of all this is that waiting for AI to do it&#x27;s thing isn&#x27;t fun. It&#x27;s slow enough that it slows me down and fast enough that I can&#x27;t really multi task. It&#x27;s like dealing with a very slow build that you have to run over and over again. A necessary evil. But not necessarily fun. I can see why a lot of developers feel like the joy is being sucked out of their lives.<p>Dealing with this pain is urgent. Part of that is investing in robust and fast builds. Build time competes with model inference in the time stuff takes. And another part is working on the UX of this. Being able to fork multiple tasks at once is hugely empowering. And switching between editing code and generating code needs to get more seamless. It feels too much like I&#x27;m sitting on my hands sometimes.",

I’m retired from 34 years of coding (and managing), and never skipped a beat. I’ve released a few apps, since retiring. I’m currently working on the first app that incorporates a significant amount of LLM assistance. It’s a backend admin tool, but I’ll probably consider using the same methodology for more public-facing stuff, in the future.<p>I am not one to just let an LLM write a whole app or server, unsupervised (I have control issues), but have allowed them to write whole functions, and help me to find the causes of bugs.<p>What LLMs have given me, is a decreased hesitance to trying new things. I’ve been learning new stuff at a furious rate. My experience makes learning very fast.

At least much better than what I was able to build over a couple of weekends. They provide real value to me. And I&#x27;m still having fun building them.<p>I now vibe coded three apps, two of them web apps, in Rust, and I couldn&#x27;t write a &quot;Hello World&quot; in Rust if you held a gun to my head. They look beautiful, are snappy, and it being Rust gives me a lot of confidence in its correctness (feel free to disagree here).<p>Of course I wouldn&#x27;t vibe code in a serious production project, but I&#x27;d still use an AI agent, except I&#x27;d make sure I understand every line it puts out.",

And in the agentic world, we use the term &#x27;context&#x27; to describe information used to help LLMs make decisions, where the context data is not part of the LLM&#x27;s training data.

Going to provide a simple example with Claude Codes.<p>I have a frontend agent instructed to not use any class or style ever, only the design system components and primitives.<p>Not only it will ignore those very quickly, but when it proposes edits and I give feedback the agent ignores them completely and instead it keeps suggesting more edits.<p>Thus I had to revert to deleting the agent completely and rely on the main thread for doing that work.<p>Same applies with any other agent.",
      "Yeah, I think designing a system for the LLM to check its own work will replace prompt engineering in key LLM techniques (though, it itself is a form of prompt engineering, but more intentional.) Given that LLMs are doing this today already (with varying success), it might not be long until that’s automated too.",
      "Appropriate feedback is critical for good long horizon performance. The direction of feedback doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be from autonomous tools back to the LLM. It can also flow from tools to humans who then iterate the prompt &#x2F; tools accordingly.<p>I&#x27;ve recently discovered that if a model gets stuck in a loop on a tool call across many different runs, it&#x27;s almost certainly because of a gap in expectations regarding what the available tools do in that context, not some random model failure mode.<p>For example, I had a tool called &quot;GetSceneOverview&quot; that was being called as expected and then devolved into looping. Once I counted how many times it was looping I realized it was internally trying to pass per-item arguments in a way I couldn&#x27;t see from outside the OAI API black box. I had never provided a &quot;GetSceneObjectDetails&quot; method (or explanation for why it doesn&#x27;t exist) so it tried the next best thing foreach item returned in the overview.<p>I went one step further and asked the question &quot;can the LLM just directly tell me what the tooling expectation gap is?&quot; And sure enough it can. If you provide the model with a ReportToolIssue tool, you&#x27;ll start to get these insights a lot more directly. Once I had cleared non-trivial reports of tool concerns, the looping issues all but vanished. It was catching things I simply couldn&#x27;t see. The best insight was the fact that I hadn&#x27;t provided parent ids for each scene object (I assumed not relevant for my test command), so it was banging its head on those tools trying to figure out the hierarchy. I didn&#x27;t realize how big a problem this was until I saw it complaining about it every time I ran the experiment."

      "I went down (continue to do down) this rabbit hole and agree with the author.<p>I tried a few different ideas and the most stable&#x2F;useful so far has been giving the agent a single run_bash tool, explicitly prompting it to create and improve composable CLIs, and injecting knowledge about these CLIs back into it&#x27;s system prompt (similar to have agent skills work).<p>This leads to really cool pattens like:\n1. User asks for something<p>2. Agent can&#x27;t do it, so it creates a CLI<p>3. Next time it&#x27;s aware of the CLI and uses it. If the user asks for something it can&#x27;t do it either improves the CLI it made, or creates a new CLI.<p>4. Each interaction results in updated&#x2F;improved toolkits for the things you ask it for.<p>You as the user can use all these CLIs as well which ends up an interesting side-channel way of interacting with the agent (you add a todo using the same CLI as what it uses for example).<p>It&#x27;s also incredibly flexible, yesterday I made a &quot;coding agent&quot; by having it create tools to inspect&#x2F;analyze&#x2F;edit a codebase and it could go off and do most things a coding agent can.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caesarnine&#x2F;binsmith\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caesarnine&#x2F;binsmith</a>",

Any code cell can be (edited and) re-run by the human, and any cells &quot;downstream&quot; of the cell will be recalculated... up to the point of the first cell (code <i>or</i> text) whose assumptions become invalidated by the change — at which point you get a context-history branch, and the inference resumes from that branch point against the modified context.",

Each step declares what it can touch, what tools it can use, and what kind of output is allowed. When the step ends, that authority disappears.<p>The agent becomes less clever, but way more predictable. Fewer surprising edits, fewer cascading mistakes.<p>We ended up using GTWY for this style of step-gated agent work, and it made long-running agents feel manageable instead of fragile.",

      "At $DAYJOBSTARTUP, we do hackathons twice a year. At the most recent one, an engineer sat down with a designer and set him up with Cursor. The designer looked like a kind in a candy shop, he was so excited to be able to rapidly prototype with natural language and not be clicking in Figma for hours.<p>A month later, he comes back to the engineering team with a 10k line &quot;index.html&quot; file asking &quot;How do I hand this off?&quot; (he was definitely smart enough to know that just passing that file to us was not gonna fly). We decided to copy the designs into Figma for the handoff, both because that was the existing way we did design&#x2F;engineering handoffs and also because creating high fidelity designs (e.g., &quot;this color from our design system&quot; and &quot;this standard spacing value&quot;) isn&#x27;t in Cursor&#x27;s wheelhouse.<p>We&#x27;re probably going to spend more time working on a better setup for him. At the very least he should be working against our codebase and components and colors and design tokens. But I&#x27;m very curious to see where it goes from here.",
      "I&#x27;m curious to understand more about your use case. I&#x27;ve been working on getting fellow designers out of Figma since it&#x27;s easier to express intent in code now using LLMs.",
      "I like how MCP is not shoved into our face anymore after people realised more mcp servers eat into context and agents can easily use CLI tools.",
      "I can attest that ai agent executing cli binaries is better than use of an mcp, just because of the limitations of mcp, also figma mcp requires a pro license. Does the figma cli require a pro license as well ?",
      "Can it make a SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle?",
      "This is interesting, and I keep waiting for figma to release prompt to design without going thru Make.  It must be touch to crack-or it will hurt their business model.  The plug-ins in the space don’t respect components in the toolkit.  Curious how far you can push this\n“Make a login form using my component library “\n“Create no new design layouts of the selected frame”\nCan’t wait to try this out!",
      "Nice use case! I built something along similar lines.. an ASCII wireframe generator to jump straight from idea to code with zero friction: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bareminimum.design&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bareminimum.design&#x2F;</a>. Also handy for quick UI critiques. Curious what you think.",
      "What&#x27;s your opinion on PenPot - Figma&#x27;s biggest rival?\nI think PenPot is more dev-friendly. Their &quot;Code&quot; mode is 100% free",
      "As a product designer, this looks really interesting! I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;ve experimented throwing caution to the wind and asking it to make an entire design system (colors, text, components), and if so, how well it&#x27;s worked.",
      "This is huge. As someone who&#x27;s put together a somewhat cohesive product but wants to take the next step in &quot;formalizing&quot; components there is a huge missing piece for design.<p>If I know my backend works I can use claude to add sufficient tests and iterate from there, improving code maturity. If my UX looks good how can I formalize it and do the same?<p>I can&#x27;t wait to try this out. My current workflow has been use MCP to screenshot the whole app --&gt; Use a tool like Codia to go from screenshot to components, as a non-designer its miserable though."

To me, if you&#x27;re not using any of the actual game&#x27;s content CDPR can&#x27;t reasonably claim that you&#x27;re infringing on their copyright, but ianal.",

      "&gt; Beads, which is basically some sort of issue tracker for agents, is 240,000 lines of code that … manages markdown files in GitHub repositories. And the code quality is abysmal.<p>I&#x27;d heard of beads as a lightweight issue tracker for agents, so this gave me a real shock. What could all that code POSSIBLY be doing? Going to the repo and poking around, I truly cannot tell. There&#x27;s an enormous `docs&#x2F;` folder with no hierarchy, containing files like `MULTI_REPO_HYDRATION.md`, which &quot;describes the implementation of Task 3 from the multi-repo support feature (bd-307): the hydration layer that loads issues from multiple JSONL files into a unified SQLite database,&quot; and `ANTIVIRUS.md`, a 7KB text file about how `bd.exe` sometimes gets flagged as untrustworthy by antivirus software.<p>I opened a random go file, `detect_pollution.go`. This is a CLI command for detecting and cleaning up test tickets from a production database by (1) scanning ticket titles for testing-related prefixes like &quot;debug,&quot; &quot;test,&quot; or &quot;benchmark,&quot; (2) scanning for short descriptions, (3) scanning for suspicious phrases like &quot;sample ticket,&quot; and (4) scanning for batches of tickets that were created all at once. It uses these signals to compute a confidence score for each ticket that determines whether it should be deleted. This command was deprecated and replaced by `doctor_pollution.go`, which reimplements large parts of `detect_pollution.go` and is not, at a glance, substantially different. Two seconds of thought will tell you that this feature is unnecessary, since you can create tickets with a &quot;#test&quot; tag and then delete them by tag.<p>I don&#x27;t want to come across as mean, but Steve should be embarrassed by this. It&#x27;s grotesquely baroque and completely unmaintainable—proof positive that whatever he&#x27;s doing isn&#x27;t working.",

      "n our experience, most agent failures weren’t model issues but intent drift. The agent starts with a narrow goal, then gradually “helpfully” expands scope because nothing re-asserts intent between steps.<p>What worked for us was making intent explicit per step and treating it as a constraint, not just context. Each step declares what it’s allowed to do, which tools it can touch, and what kind of output is valid. After the step finishes, that authority is torn down.<p>The system feels less flexible, but far more predictable. Fewer clever shortcuts, fewer surprises.<p>That’s essentially how GTWY approaches agent workflows, and it’s been a practical way to keep agents aligned without relying on heavier prompts or post-hoc validation."
