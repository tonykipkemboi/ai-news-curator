      "No surprises.<p>No matter how we look at it, EVs are much friendlier and safer to the environment. Some people argue the source of electricty can be contested against because that involves fossil fuel burning again, but in today&#x27;s world we are rapidly moving away from it and towards nuclear&#x2F;hydel&#x2F;wind methods for generating power.<p>I hope ICE cars completely become a thing of the past in the next couple of decades to come.",
      "i moved to beijing in 2015.. and i have to buy a air purifier, prepare masks for winter. pepople talks about air polutions so much, it feels like we are struggle, not living a life. i remember one day, it was so bad, i have to wear gas mask to go outisde, i know it&#x27;s rare, and people are staring, but yes, its that hard.<p>it&#x27;s 2026 now, you barely see bad days in Beijing, most people wear mask only for the flu, not for the air pollutions. basically its only a few days in winter.  and just wait for the wind, it all goes away.<p>shutdown factory and move them to other places sure helps, but nobody will deny that adopt ev contributes a lot. i remeber the sales data for 2024 is nearly 45%+ of new cars are EV, and 2025 is 51.8%. i&#x27;m sure the number will go up and reach nearly 100%.",
      "The real scandal isn’t just battery degradation… it’s that manufacturers have zero incentive to solve it. Your car becoming worthless after a decade suits them down to the ground.<p>Battery swapping changes the game entirely. Imagine a national network of exchange stations (co-located with existing petrol infrastructure, you can use the overhead canopy for solar). Standard pack sizes scaled by vehicle class: compact cars get 2 cells, vans get 4, lorries get 8.<p>Whoever owns these battery packs now has skin in the game for longevity. Their profit depends on keeping packs in service for 20+ years, not selling you a new car.<p>Suddenly the R&amp;D money flows towards batteries that last, obsolescence now costs them money, and isn’t a happy accident that keeps you hooked on buying more cars.<p>You’d still have the option to buy your own packs outright if you only ever charge at home, but the network creates the economic pressure for genuine improvement of longevity in battery tech that’s <i>completely</i> missing today.<p>I’m aware that a company called “Better Place” failed. But they were a startup trying to strong-arm the automotive industry. A nationally coordinated infrastructure concern is different, and the air quality data from this study suggests we can’t afford to keep muddling through - and I really think that peoples concerns about batteries are not misplaced.<p>Perfect is the enemy of good, but damned if we can’t at least align incentives for <i>better</i>.",
      "I want the future to focus more on the brakes and tire dust, and the increase in cancers and other problems by people who live near busy roads or highways experience. Nobody studies this, and combustion or battery, everyone is affected by it. Even playgrounds are filled with shredded tires, which borders on biohazard.",
      "I know I will be damned for this comment but nevertheless even EVs produce pollution with regard to tire abrasion. Tire abrasion itself is the main contributor to microplastics",
      "Anyone can argue ICE vs EV all night long but there&#x27;s only 1 metric I care about, in favor of EV:<p>When I am going to take my son to school, he doesn&#x27;t have to smell the gas and the fumes from the exhaust in the garage.",
      "This study is about air quality <i>in neighborhoods</i>. So it would show the same thing even if EVs just moved pollution from where people use their cars to where power plants get placed, because that&#x27;s not the question it&#x27;s addressing.",
      "You can already tell how much of a difference it makes in a city. Visiting Boracay after visiting other philipin island is heaven. I heard some Chinese cities are basically just EV, I can’t imagine how much nicer it could be to walk through New York without all that noise pollution",
      "If you live in North America and have a house or townhouse get a Tesla. It is such a no brainer. $5 for 500km vs $100 for 500km (gas) is just too good",
      "I love EVs, ever since I test drove an BMW i3 in 2012. Quiet with high drag - of course this is the future.<p>BUT I don&#x27;t think switching to EVs will help reduce CO2 in any way - not even if all the EVs are charged using 100% solar&#x2F;wind. The narrative usually is &quot;I get an EV instead of an ICE, charge it with regenerative energy and have 0 emissions, thus not burning oil and saving on CO2&quot;.<p>But that is not how a globalized world with free markets works. In order to save on CO2, we would need to keep that oil not burned by the EV underground, but that does not take place. The market reality is that oil price will just drop with less demand from ICE vehicles. But with falling prices, other business models that require refined oil will become viable and the oil is still burned - just somewhere else. No one so far has made a good argument why the Saudis or Russians would leave their ressources underground, just because demand from ICE vehicles drop."

      "Ok it might sound crazy but I actually got the best quality of code (completely ignoring that the cost is likely 10x more) by having a full “project team” using opencode with multiple sub agents which are all managed by a single Opus instance. I gave them the task to port a legacy Java server to C# .NET 10. 9 agents, 7-stage Kanban with isolated Git Worktrees.<p>Manager (Claude Opus 4.5): Global event loop that wakes up specific agents based on folder (Kanban) state.<p>Product Owner (Claude Opus 4.5): Strategy. Cuts scope creep<p>Scrum Master (Opus 4.5): Prioritizes backlog and assigns tickets to technical agents.<p>Architect (Sonnet 4.5): Design only. Writes specs&#x2F;interfaces, never implementation.<p>Archaeologist (Grok-Free): Lazy-loaded. Only reads legacy Java decompilation when Architect hits a doc gap.<p>CAB (Opus 4.5): The Bouncer. Rejects features at Design phase (Gate 1) and Code phase (Gate 2).<p>Dev Pair (Sonnet 4.5 + Haiku 4.5): AD-TDD loop. Junior (Haiku) writes failing NUnit tests; Senior (Sonnet) fixes them.<p>Librarian (Gemini 2.5): Maintains &quot;As-Built&quot; docs and triggers sprint retrospectives.<p>You might ask yourself the question “isn’t this extremely unnecessary?” and the answer is most likely _yes_. But I never had this much fun watching AI agents at work (especially when CAB rejects implementations).\nThis was an early version of the process that the AI agents are following (I didn’t update it since it was only for me anyway): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;rdEBU5I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;rdEBU5I</a>",
      "This is just sub agents, built into Claude. You don’t need 300,000 line tmux abstractions written in go. You just tell Claude to do work in parallel with background sub agents. It helps to have a file for handing off the prompt, tracking progress, and reporting back. I also recommend constraining agents to their own worktrees. I am writing down the pattern here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workforest.space\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workforest.space</a> while nearly everyone is building orchestrators i also noticed claude is already the best orchestrator for claude.",
      "I want it to generate better code but less of it, and be more proactive about getting human feedback before it starts going off the rails. This sounds like an inexorable push in the opposite direction.<p>I can see this approach being useful once the foundation is more robust, has better common sense, knows when to push back when requirements conflict or are underspecified. But with current models I can only see this approach as exacerbating the problem; coding agents solution is almost always &quot;more code&quot;, not less. Makes for a nice demo, but I can&#x27;t imagine this would build anything that wouldn&#x27;t have huge operational problems and 10x-100x more code than necessary.",
      "This feels like massively overengineering something very simple.<p>Agents are stateless functions with a limited heap (context window) that degrades in quality as it fills. Once you see it that way, the whole swarm paradigm is just function scoping and memory management cosplaying as an org chart:<p>Agent = function<p>Role = scope constraints<p>Context window = local memory<p>Shared state file = global state<p>Orchestration = control flow<p>The solution isn&#x27;t assigning human-like roles to stateless functions. It&#x27;s shared state (a markdown file) and clear constraints.",
      "I&#x27;d really like to see a regular poll on HN that keeps track of which AI coding agents are the most popular among this community, like the TIOBE Index for programming languages.<p>Hard to keep up with all the changes and it would be nice to see a high level view of what people are using and how that might be shifting over time.",
      "&gt;<i>You&#x27;re not talking to an AI coder anymore. You&#x27;re talking to a team lead. The lead doesn&#x27;t write code - it plans, delegates, and synthesizes.</i><p>They couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to write the Tweet themselves...",
      "I&#x27;ve done plenty of vibe coding even though I know how to program but I mostly work with a single agent through its CLI. The progress is really good and more importantly, I can follow it. I can read the output, test it, and understand what changed and why. I don&#x27;t see much upside in swarms. But I do see the downside which is losing the ability to keep the whole system in my head. The codebase starts growing in directions I didn&#x27;t choose and it seems decisions will get made I didn&#x27;t review. Early AI autocomplete that could finish a function already felt like a big productivity win and then AI that could write whole files was an even bigger jump. Like pretty massive. Running one agent at a time, watching what it does, and vetting the output still works well for me and still feels like a strong multiplier. But now there&#x27;s so much more ceremony: AGENTS.md, SKILLS.md, delegation frameworks. I guess I&#x27;m not convinced that leads to better outcomes but I&#x27;m probably missing something. It just seems like a tradeoff that sacrifices understanding for ostensible progress.",

What are learnings after 3-6 months of supporting in production?",

      "I&#x27;ve got a brute force solver for the NYT Pips game. There&#x27;s a particular puzzle that it takes 45.2 seconds on on my M2 Max Mac Studio. The solver is single threaded and doesn&#x27;t use much memory so it is mostly limited by CPU and memory speed.<p>I ran it on my Pi 3, 4, 5, Intel iMac, and on my cheap Amazon Lightsail instance. Here are the results, in seconds:<p><pre><code>  680.4  RPi 3\n  274.5  RPi 4\n  131.3  RPi 5\n  108.5  Lightsail\n   78.7  2017 iMac (3.4 GHz Intel Core i5)\n   45.2  M2 Max Mac Studio</code></pre>",
      "I think the Pi 3 range is a sweet spot for low cost, low power draw, decent-enough CPU. Newer models draw increasingly more power; going from 1.4W to 2.8W may not seem like much, but that&#x27;s half your battery life. There&#x27;s a few differences in Raspberry Pi 3 versions that may lead you to buy one or the other:<p>- The <i>Pi 3B</i> has 10&#x2F;100 Ethernet, 802.11n (single-band) WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1. Power idled at 1.4W and peaked at 3.7W.<p>- The <i>Pi 3B+</i> removed the 10&#x2F;100 Ethernet in favor of USB Ethernet (~300Mbps w&#x2F;USB2.0). CPU cores were overclocked from 1.2GHz to 1.4GHz (so a heatsink is more necessary), with ~15% increase in benchmark performance. It added 802.11ac (dual band) WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2 w&#x2F;BLE. Power idled at 1.9W and peaked at 5.1W. This is also the only 3-model supporting PoE (w&#x2F; extra HAT).<p>- The <i>Pi 3A+</i> removed Ethernet and reduced USB to a single port. The RAM was reduced from 1GB to 512MB. Power idled at 1.13W and peaked at 4.1W. The <i>A+</i> form factor is more compact. Overall the <i>3A+</i> is smaller, cheaper, and less power draw than the <i>3B+</i> (but not as low as the 3B).<p>The lowest power draw with acceptable performance is the <i>3B</i>. For slightly more power draw and more CPU performance, go with <i>3A+</i>. For &quot;everything&quot; (including PoE) the <i>3B+</i> is it.<p>If you want the <i>3A+</i> but don&#x27;t need the video, want a smaller form factor, and half the power draw, the <i>Pi Zero 2 W</i> is it. Though the <i>Pi Zero 2 W</i> is supposed to be cheapest, due to demand it&#x27;s often sold out or more expensive. The <i>3A+</i> is still cheap (~$25) and available, with the downside of the higher power draw and larger form factor.<p>(disabling HDMI, LEDs, Wifi, Bluetooth, etc reduces power draw more. in testing, the <i>3A+</i> drew less power than the <i>Zero 2 W</i> with everything disabled. all of them draw ~0.1W when powered off)",

      "About 7 years ago, we deployed a “gateway&#x2F;orchestration” role device in ag tech. Power draw is a big concern for us (not a lot of free power out in the middle of fields). We used an SBC from Emtrion. I remember asking my EE counterpart at the time “why not a Pi? Surely someone makes hardened versions of those?” He was skeptical and I think the aura of “toy&#x2F;hobby&#x2F;maker” scared him off.<p>Fast forward. We’re getting ready to role out our next generation. It’s based on the Pi Compute Module 4 (the CMs are basically just the basic Pi and you put your own carrier board for peripherals under it). It is amazing. It has easily 20x the power, 20x the RAM, better temp specs and such, a great eco system, uses about 30% less power, and about 1&#x2F;5 of the price. The only thing we’re not sure about yet, is the robustness of the BLE with the onboard radio chip.<p>It’s amazing how far these things have come.

These have been <i>incredibly</i> valuable.<p>We still &#x27;yolo&#x27; into PRs, use agents to improve code quality, do initial checks via gating.  We&#x27;re trying to get docs working through the same approach.  We see huge value in automating and lightweight orchestration of agents, but other parts of the whole system are the bottleneck, so theres no real point in running more than a couple of agents concurrently - claude could already build a low quality version our entire backlog in a week.<p>Is anyone exploring the (imo more practically useful today) space of using agents to put together better changes vs &quot;more commits&quot;?",

      "The same is happening to a lot of website owners. You lose half or more of your traffic to AI summaries trained on your own content. The cost of producing original content is the same as before.<p>It makes research harder too, since more and more public information is infected by AI content. Both published posts and internet discussions are tainted.<p>And then the AI companies threaten to crash the whole economy if we don&#x27;t let them do it.",
      "Would like to point out that professional translation has been under pressure for much longer than AI.<p>I have friends that made a descent buck 20-30 years ago translating technical documents like car manuals. Over the years, prices fell from quarters per words to fractions of a cent.<p>And even though machine translation was barely existent, <i>tools</i> were used to argue higher productivity and therefore lower prices.",
      "&gt; While using AI tools for everyday tasks like finding directions is “low-risk,” human translators will likely need to be involved for the foreseeable future in diplomatic, legal, financial and medical contexts where the risks are “humungous,” according to Benzo<p>Now it&#x27;s a classic, you need an expert in order to check the work of the machine, because the &quot;customer&quot; is by definition not able to do it.<p>Aside from highly technical domain, in purely literary works, I think that the translator is a co-author - maybe IP laws acknowledges that already? I remember the translation of E.A. Poe by C. Baudelaire for instance; I think you could feel Baudelaire&#x27;s style because it is a lot &quot;warmer&quot; than Poe&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve also read a translation of a Japanese novel and I was quite disappointed with it. I don&#x27;t know Japanese but I have read&#x2F;watched quite a few mangas&#x2F;animes, so I could sense the speech patterns behind the translations and sometimes thought they could have made better choices.<p>In any case, one will still need a translator who is good at &quot;prompt engineering&quot; to get a quality translation. I don&#x27;t know. Maybe translators can add this skill to their CV, so they can propose quick-and-dirty&#x2F;cheap translations, or no-AI high quality translations.<p>Some suggest &quot;no-AI&quot; labels on cultural products already - I think if it becomes a reality it will probably act as &quot;quality signaling&quot;, because it is becoming more difficult every year to tell the difference between AI and human productions. It won&#x27;t matter if what you read was written by an AI or a human (if it quacks and looks like a duck...), but what the customer will probably want is to avoid poorly-prompted machine translation.",
      "Recently I&#x27;ve noticed that the subtitles on TV shows have become garbage. Often the translations makes no sense in the context of what is happening, but are literal translations of what is being said on screen. I assume it&#x27;s some kind of AI translation, but who knows. Maybe the translator is just stupid.<p>To be clear, we had bad subtitles before as well, but that was due to the translators lack of cultural understanding. Most of it made sense at least. Now it&#x27;s just straight up bad and often makes no sense. Sad!",
      "AI translations are getting good. I&#x27;ve been working on our company website in the last month. It&#x27;s a static website. So, I use Agentic coding tools to implement both content and technical changes. A simple prompt &quot;align the translations with the English version for all pages&quot; and some guard rails in the form of skills and AGENTS.md instructions are doing most of the heavy lifting. To be clear.<p>These translations are not perfect, yet. But good enough for my needs. Any professional translator services would in any case be beyond our budget. The advantage of using agentic coding tools here (enabled by using a site generator rather than a CMS) is that I can get systematic about dealing with jargon, SEO, and frequently used phrases. I simply document all that and instruct the tool to refer to that. The funny thing is that most of the models are pretty good at fixing their own mistakes if you just ask them too. I asked it to look for examples of &quot;denglish&quot; (German English) in its own German translations and then to fix it. It found a few examples and the suggested fixes were fine.<p>A lot of people are focusing on the negative here. I like to look at the positive. We&#x27;re approaching the moment where any person on this planet will be able to communicate directly with any other person on this planet without the need for translators. The tools already exist for this. But they need a lot of work on quality.<p>A second point here is that the role of English as the most popular intermediary language is disappearing as well. I&#x27;m not a native speaker. When I talk to foreigners from wherever, it&#x27;s mostly in (bad) English. By definition that limits me to talking to people that have had enough education and exposure to English. This is very limiting. A lot of the people we need to talk to here in Germany aren&#x27;t all that comfortable speaking English.",
      "Anyone else worries that by contributing to open source software these days one is also digging his&#x2F;her own grave?",
      "Commercial translator services lately are the worst they have ever been. You cant validate that they aren&#x27;t directly sending your excel with the translation lines into a LLM with no tweaking&#x2F;checking.<p>For a indie videogame i work on, we tried a couple translation agencies, and they gave terrible output. At the end, we built our own LLM based agentic translation, with lots of customization for our specific project like building a prompt based on where the menu&#x2F;string is at, shared glossary, and other features. Testing this against the agencies, it was better because we could customize it for the needs of our specific game.<p>Even then, at the end of the day, we went with freelancers for some of the languages as we couldn&#x27;t really validate the AI output on those languages.The freelancers took a month to do the translation vs the 2-3 days we ourselves took for the languages we knew and we could monitor the AI output. But they did a nice job, much better than the agencies.<p>I feel that what AI really completely kills is those translation services. Its not hard at all to build or customize your own AI system, so if the agency is going to charge you considerable money for AI output, just do it yourself and get a better result. Meanwhile those freelancers are still in demand as they can actually check the project and understand it for a nice translation, unlike the mechanical agencies where you send them the excel and they send it to who knows what or an AI without you being able to check.<p>I will likely be opensourcing this customizable AI translation system for my project soon.",

Any distance between the source and target language (e.g. English -&gt; Chinese) and it&#x27;d be one big joke. With plain Google Translate it still is. But the market spoke: Probably you don&#x27;t need a very good translation most of the time. Especially not if the shitty one is free.<p>In her later years she moved to transcription of board meetings. She&#x27;d type up everything that was said.<p>I work for a company now that automates transcription via the whisper model and generates summaries that can be adapted by the customer. You pay per minute of transcription, and you can regenerate summaries as much as you want after that until your prompts give the right results.<p>All of this manual labor that provided for my childhood is gone now.<p>I couldn&#x27;t imagine being a professional translator today and not use AI extensively.<p>But unless I have a legal reason to consult with a professional translator, I probably don&#x27;t even need one, since LLM-based translation is as good as it gets with just plain LLM usage, and near perfect with automated translation tools that will help you pick both the mood, formality and alternative formulations for your translation.<p>High-grade translation is massively parallelisable, and a human-in-the-loop is entirely for final proof-reading.",
      "AI translation is so much usable these days I think.<p>I had a report&#x2F;article (using Claude) on methods to fall asleep. First method worked amazingly and I am doing that every night. I translated it to Urdu using Gemini (because they are doing translations for a long time, they must be better). First translation used very stiff&#x2F;dry language, something you might read in a research paper etc. I asked it to simplify it for my mom the language and to my astonishment, it did that very very well.<p>Urdu surely must not have as much data as other languages. I could not find a single mistake. Yeah there were some weird choices of words in original version, but the simpler was so good it can be published like an article.",
      "I will take a more positive view, all the translators being put out of buisness will take up literary translation and we will enter a golden age when it comes to translated literature. AI still has a very long ways to go here and there is a great deal of untranslated literature out there and literature which only has a terrible translation. Probably won&#x27;t happen but maybe the struggling publishing industry will see the opportunity provided by a glut of out of work translators and jump on it.<p>One can dream."

      "I used to create a number of simple web pages in XHTML back in the days when we believed XHTML was the future. Recently, while going through and restructuring some of my old &quot;online stuff&quot;, I learned that XHTML really isn&#x27;t in a state that I&#x27;d want to use it any more:<p>* XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 are officially deprecated by the W3C.<p>* XHTML5 exists as a variant of HTML5. However, it&#x27;s very clear that it&#x27;s absolutely not a priority for the HTML5 working groups, and there&#x27;s a statement that future features will not necessarily be supported by the XHTML5 variant.<p>* XHTML5 does not have a DTD, so one of the main advantages of XHTML - that you can validate its correctness with pure XML functionality - isn&#x27;t there.<p>* If you do a &#x27;view source&#x27; in Firefox on a completely valid XHTML 1.0&#x2F;1.1 page, it&#x27;ll redline the XML declaration like it&#x27;s something wrong. Not sure if this is intended or possibly even a bug, but it certainly gives me a &#x27;browser tells me this is not supposed to be there&#x27; feeling.<p>It pretty much seems to me XHTML has been abandoned by the web community. My personal conclusion has been that whenever I touch any of my old online things still written in XHTML, I&#x27;ll convert them to HTML5.",
      "XHTML survives in ePub. Recently there was a survey to gather industry feedback for a potential addition of an HTML flavour of ePub to be added to the next version of the spec, but it soon became fairly clear that people saw a lot of value in remaining XHTML-only: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2026&#x2F;epub-and-html-survey-results-and-next-steps&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2026&#x2F;epub-and-html-survey-results-an...</a>",

      "I highly recommend everyone involved in web development to read at least a small proportion of the horrors that are the HTML parser specification. It will leave you yearning for the return of XHTML.<p>Or you could also read web proposals where the reason for avoiding the ideal implementation is complication of updating HTML parser rules.<p>Or attempt to use the web features that are already hindered by the HTML parser (custom element table rows).",
      "I would really like to use XHTML. It would make my HTML emitter much simpler (as I don&#x27;t need special rules for elements that are self-closing, have special closing or escaping rules and whatever else) and more secure.<p>However no browsers have implemented streaming XHTML parsers. This means that the performance is notably worse for XHTML and if you rely on streaming responses (I currently do for a few pages like bulk imports) it won&#x27;t work.",

This is a common debate - but for simplicity sake I&#x27;m just calling it this.<p>It&#x27;s not really a debate, HTML is a markup language [1], not a programming language: you annotate a document with its structure and its formatting. You are not really programming when you write HTML (the markup is not procedural) (and this is not gatekeeping, there&#x27;s nothing wrong about this and doesn&#x27;t make HTML a lesser language).<p>To avoid the issue completely, you can phrase this as: &quot;you should master HTML&quot; and remove the footnote.

Grokipedia uses Grok and Grok trains on X, which is highly manipulated by both X itself (lots of people allege suppressed reach and other forms of shadow bans if you’re left of MAGA) and by bots. Not to mention the platform is naturally one sided when toxic content (racists, misogynists, outright supremacists, etc) drives away those of different views. For example look at Vivek Ramaswamy quitting X recently after all his posts got flooded with nearly 100% vile racist replies.",
      "This sounds more like an issue with whatever web search&#x2F;index tool GPT is using rather than the language model itself.",
