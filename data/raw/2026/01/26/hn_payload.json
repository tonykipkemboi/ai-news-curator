Unfortunately, one has to cut through the marketing &quot;magic&quot; to find the main engineering value; stripping away the &quot;polyglot&quot; shell-script hacks and the &quot;Actually Portable Executable&quot; container (which are undoubtedly innovative), the core benefit proposition of Cosmopolitan is indeed a platform-agnostic, statically-linked C standard (plus some Posix) library that performs runtime system call translation, so to say &quot;the Musl we have been waiting for&quot;.",
      "Is there a tool that takes an executable, collects all the required .so files and produces either a static executable, or a package that runs everywhere?",

      "It&#x27;s funny how people insist on wanting to link everything statically when shared libraries were specifically designed to have a better alternative.<p>Even worse is containers, which has the disadvantage of both.",
      "This seems interesting even regardless of go. Is it realistic to create an  executable which would work on very different kinds of Linux distros? e.g. 32-bit and 64-bit? Or maybe some general framework&#x2F;library for building an arbitrary program at least for &quot;any libc&quot;?",

Does replacing that lengthy text with &quot;if you aren&#x27;t sure of the answer say you don&#x27;t know&quot; have the same exact effect?",
      "This is the classic &#x27;plausible hallucination&#x27; problem. In my own testing with coding agents, we see this constantly—LLMs will invent a method that sounds correct but doesn&#x27;t exist in the library.<p>The only fix is tight verification loops. You can&#x27;t trust the generative step without a deterministic compilation&#x2F;execution step immediately following it. The model needs to be punished&#x2F;corrected by the environment, not just by the prompter.",
      "You don’t need a test to know this we already know there’s heavy reinforcement training done on these models so it optimizes for passing the training. Passing the training means convincing the person rating the answers and that the answer is good.<p>The keyword is convince. So it just needs to convince people that’s it’s right.<p>It is optimizing for convincing people. Out of all answers that can convince people some can be actual correct answers, others can be wrong answers.",
      "it seems to me like this is very much an artefact of the left-to-right top-down writing method of the program. Once its committed to a token earlier in its response it kinda just has to go with it. Thats why im so interested in those LLM models that work more like stable diffusion, where they can go back and iterate repeatedly on the output.",
      "I like how this article was itself clearly written with the help of an LLM.<p>(You can particularly tell from the &quot;Conclusions&quot; section.  The formatting, where each list item starts with a few-word bolded summary, is already a strong hint, but the real issue is the repetitiveness of the list items.  For bonus points there&#x27;s a &quot;not X, but Y&quot;, as well as a dash, albeit not an em dash.)",
      "This also can be observed with more advanced math proofs. ChatGPT 5.2 pro is the best public model at math at the moment, but if pushed out of its comfort zone will make simple (and hard to spot) errors like stating an inequality but then applying it in a later step with the inequality reversed (not justified).",
      "They can all write lean4 now, don&#x27;t accept numbers that don&#x27;t carry proofs. The CAS I use for builds has a coeffect discharge cert in the attestation header, couple lines of code. Graded monads are a snap in CIC.",
      "I remember when ChatGPT first came out, I asked it for a proof for Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which it happily gave me.<p>It was fascinating, because it was doing a lot of understandable mistakes that 7th graders make.  For example, I don&#x27;t remember the surrounding context but it decided that you could break `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` into `sqrt(x^2) + sqrt(y^2) =&gt; x + y`. It&#x27;s interesting because it was one of those &quot;ASSUME FALSE&quot; proofs; if you can assume false, then mathematical proofs become considerably easier.",
      "I am actually surprised that the LLM came so close. I doubt it had examples in its training set for these numbers. This goes to the heart of &quot;know-how&quot;. The LLM should should have said: &quot;I am not sure&quot; but instead gets into rhetoric to justify itself. It actually mimics human behavior for motivated reasoning. At orgs, management is impressed with this overconfident motivated reasoner as it mirrors themselves. To hell with the facts, and the truth, persuation is all that matters.",
      "In the theory of the psychology of creativity, there are phenomena which constitute distortions of the motivational setting for creative problem-solving which are referred to as &#x27;extrinsic rewards&#x27;. Management theory bumped into this kind of phenomenon with the advent of the introduction of the first appearance of &#x27;gamification&#x27; as a motivational toolkit, where &#x27;scores&#x27; and &#x27;badges&#x27; were awarded to participants in online activities. The psychological community reacted to this by pointing out that earlier research had shown that whilst extrinsics can indeed (at least initially) boost participation by introducing notions of competitiveness, it turned out that they were ultimately poor substitutes for the far more sustainable and productive intrinsic motivational factors, like curiosity, if it could be stimulated effectively (something which itself inevitably required more creativity on the part of the designer of the motivational resources). It seems that the motivational analogue in inference engines is an extrinsic reward process."

      "Nice app but it really needs to allow the user to select the lights of interest before it displays. As noted in a different thread it has a display limit of 500 points and you need to zoom in pretty tight to see anything pop up in some places, like the Great Lakes, due to huge number of lights that are in the populated list.<p>The legend should show the color coded lights and allow the user to toggle each light type as a layer so that they can identify specific points of interest.<p>It is functionally unusable in some areas due to the huge number of navigational buoys, etc along inland rivers and it apparently has a problem determining window extents and centering the display on the user&#x27;s area of interest. If you display the entire Great Lakes region you will find that your displayed lights are along a couple of rivers in the lower left with nothing in the center of the display. If you shuffle to the north a bit and zoom another notch it suddenly fills the lower right corner, still with nothing in the center of the display.<p>Filtering by type of light would solve a lot of that if you keep the 500 point limit.<p>I understand that it took a lot to get this far.

According to the CIAF, the break in the track was &quot;practically undetectable.&quot; The fracture on the track was not noticed by the trains that passed over it, or by the technicians responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure.<p>2. The damaged train, which belongs to the Italian company Iryo, is heavier than other trains running on the track; the additional weight of the Iryo train may have been a factor, or possibly even one of the causes, of the derailment.<p>3. The CIAF said that the notches registered in the wheels and the deformation in the rail are &quot;compatible&quot; with the fact that the track was broken before the Iryo train passed over it.<p>4. Spanish Transportation Minister Óscar Puente rejected criticism of the delay of the rescuers; according to the Minister, rescuers arrived within &quot;18 minutes.&quot;<p>The full article is available here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jornada.com.mx&#x2F;2026&#x2F;01&#x2F;24&#x2F;mundo&#x2F;020n3mun\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jornada.com.mx&#x2F;2026&#x2F;01&#x2F;24&#x2F;mundo&#x2F;020n3mun</a>",
