      "<i>&gt;In traditional industries like manufacturing you don’t hire 500 factory workers unless you have a production line that needs them. You don’t over-hire based on a guess.</i><p>Traditional factories do make wrong guesses about the future and overhire all the time.  Example:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=Ford+f150+lightning+laid+off+1600\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=Ford+f150+lightning+laid+off...</a>",
      "Anecdotally, I didn&#x27;t see more safety for engineers working on cash cows. Quite the contrary, if a product is already bringing revenue, it is an easy decision for the business to squeeze a bit more margin by letting people go. Stable, cash-generating projects are often first to be put into efficiency&#x2F;maintenance mode.",
      "Interesting framing. The article makes a compelling case that we&#x27;re seeing the hangover from 14 years of ZIRP-fueled hiring rather than an AI apocalypse.<p>But I&#x27;m curious what people think the equilibrium looks like. If the &quot;two-tier system&quot; (core revenue teams + disposable experimental teams) becomes the norm, what does that mean for the future of SWE as a career?<p>A few scenarios I keep turning over:<p><pre><code>  1. Bifurcation - A small elite of &quot;10x engineers&quot; command premium comp while the majority compete for increasingly commoditized roles                                                       \n  2. Craftsmanship revival - Companies learn that the &quot;disposable workforce&quot; model ships garbage, and there&#x27;s renewed appreciation for experienced engineers who stick around                 \n  3. Consulting&#x2F;contractor becomes default - Full-time employment becomes rare; most devs work project-to-project like other creative industries                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                              </code></pre>\nThe article argues AI isn&#x27;t the cause, but it seems like it could accelerate whatever trend is already in motion. If companies are already treating engineers as interchangeable inventory, AI tooling gives them cover to reduce headcount further.<p>For those of you 10+ years into your careers: are you optimistic about staying in IC roles long-term, or does management&#x2F;entrepreneurship feel like the only sustainable path?",
      "From around 2010-2020 the stock market was rewarding growth more than profit. That means large tech employers hired like crazy to indicate growth.<p>Then came COVID and the economy contracted. As a result the stock market changed to reward profitability. So, excess developers had to go. We are still feeling this.<p>I do agree that AI is not to blame for this. In fact I will go further and claim that AI is a net negative that make this worse for the employer by ultimately requiring more people who average lower confidence and lower capabilities than without, but I say that with a huge caveat.<p>The deeper problem is not market effect or panaceas like AI. The deeper problem is poorly qualified workers and hard to identify talent. It’s easy to over hire, and then fire, when everyone generally sucks and doesn’t matter. If the average employed developer is excellent at what they deliver these people would be easy to identify and tough to fire like engineers, doctors, and lawyers. If the typical developer is excellent at what they do AI would be a complete net negative.<p>AI and these market shifts thus hide a lower level problem nobody wants to solve: qualification.",
      "I&#x27;m not arguing against the core arguments of the article (I agree with most of the points), but on the other hand, software development is (at least currently) an essentially iterative process - one that differs greatly from other production processes (e.g. buildings, cars). We all know how difficult it is to estimate how much development time something takes. Planning is hard and outcomes have therefore greater variability.",
      "The main issue IMHO is the monopolization of the industry, especially in the US. Once the giants do layoffs, the rest of the market can&#x27;t absorb the people effectively, which leads to oversaturated job market.<p>We can of course discuss how many people got into industry during COVID heyday and whether they should have, but mostly I think it&#x27;s about those behemoths having disproportionately high impact on the entire labour market.",
      "Proven businesses can always borrow at fairly low rates. When capital gets really cheap it starts to incentivize greater amounts of risk taking because investors actually want risk.<p>If you are starting a dry cleaning business, you have a cost of the equipment, rent and other well known factors.  Starting a tech company in a new and unproven area has different expenses and a different risk&#x2F;reward profile.<p>Malinvestment can come in a lot of flavors. Cheap capital will result in <i>too many</i> dry cleaners and also too many startups that probably <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> have gotten funding.<p>The downside comes in various forms. 1) existing dry cleaning businesses are less profitable because of increased competition, and 2) startups hire scarce engineers and drive up wages, which drive up costs for everyone.<p>Cheap capital is justified bc the goal is growth, but it is a blunt instrument that creates hot spots and neglected areas simultaneously.  Compare the approach used in the US with the approach taken by China. Chinese firms face significantly more competition than firms in the <i>capitalist</i> US, but overall China&#x27;s policies are crafted with a more deliberate eye toward their distributional consequences and notions of the greater good are much more subject to sharp critique and pressure across social and industrial strata.<p>What we are seeing in the US is that policymakers have come to believe that the growth-focused approach is an escape hatch that can be used to reduce the effects of other bad decisions, but at some point the size of the inflated economy gets big enough that it takes on a political life of its own post-911 defense contractors have dramatically more lobbying and policy-influencing power than they had prior.  Today, systemically risky financial industry participants have significantly more political clout than they had before the 2008 correction.<p>In other words, the fabric of (political) reality shifts and it becomes hard to identify what normal would look like or feel like.  In my view, AI adds fuel to the existing fire -- it rapidly shifts demand away from software engineers and onto strategists -- give the team a strategy and now with AI the team will have it done in a few weeks. If not, a competitor will do it without poaching anyone from your team.<p>And market forces include both creative <i>and</i> destructive forces. Firm failure is a <i>feature</i>, not a bug.",

      "About the same time the 500-mile email problem happened (mid 1990s), I had a difficult to understand issue with my office PC. Every morning, I&#x27;d come in, slide my hard drive sled in, and turn the computer on. We had 128 Kbps ISDN internet at the office and I had the same at home, but that was too slow to do much work. So I&#x27;d take the drive home so I could work at night, especially in the winter when the office was too cold at night.<p>Suddenly one winter morning, the PC wouldn&#x27;t boot. I had to run to a meeting. When I got back, I turned the PC off and on again and everything was fine. The next morning, the same thing happened. The third day, I didn&#x27;t have a meeting. I turned it off and back on, still no boot. I&#x27;d gotten in late, so I just turned it off and took an early lunch. When I got back, it still wouldn&#x27;t boot. But I had a meeting, so I ran to that, leaving the computer on. When I got back, it booted fine.<p>The next morning, same thing. I decided to look inside, not having any idea what might cause such symptoms. As I took the shell off, a tiny mouse came out, jump off my desk, and ran across my lap before jumping on the floor and scurrying out of sight. From inside the computer came the smell of mouse urine. Apparently he&#x27;d been crawling in through the open drive bay to keep warm every night, and urinating while he was in there. Once the computer had been on for a while, the heat and airflow would dry it out enough to eliminate whatever electrical short was keeping it from booting. I went to the store and bought an empty drive sled to put in the drive bay whenever I took my drive out, and the problem never came back. I felt lucky that the liquid didn&#x27;t cause permanent damage.",

Stellantis? $40B. Toyota? $280B. Mercedes-Benz? $60B. BMW? $55B. Volkswagen Group? Also $55B.<p>I’m sure I’ve missed plenty of others, but I could miss some 18 $50B automakers, and Tesla would still be worth more than all of them combined.<p>If Tesla was valued fairly, it would probably be at the tune of $5B. But I’ll never bet against it, because the markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent. And for some unbeknownst to me reason, the markets value Tesla as a hot tech company, not a 3rd rate automaker, which is what it actually is.<p>And to add insult to injury, even GM Super Cruise is widely renowned as better and safer than Tesla’s current “FSD”.",

Serving the consumer market directly is very expensive.<p>Their electronics, batteries, motors, etc., are world class. Packaging this up into something a partner can use to build actual cars could have less risk. An electric motor or battery can propel many kinds of automobile. They tend to keep their value better when stored in this format too.

It is far more likely that specific jobs in specific industries will be taken by AI, and AI will slowly take the labor market. This will drive down prices on products, services, and labor. Once human labor&#x27;s price is low, and once many product prices are low, the overall employment level of humans will rise.

I think there&#x27;s definitely room for sane LLM code &#x2F; vibe coded code, but you have to put in a little work to validate your changes, run every test, ensure that you understand the output and implications, not just shove a PR at the devs and hope they accept it.<p>A lot of the time open source PRs are very strategic pieces of code that do not introduce regressions, an LLM does not necessarily know or care, and someone vibe coding might not know the projects expectations. I guess instead of &#x2F; aside from a Code of Conduct, we need a sort of &quot;Expectation of Code&quot; type of document that covers the projects expectations.",

CSV exports with inconsistent date formats between the same bank&#x27;s own products. Transaction descriptions that are random truncated strings with no standardisation. Every bank formats their statements differently and some of them can&#x27;t even stay consistent between their own account types.<p>You&#x27;d think with the regulatory pressure around data accuracy this stuff would be sorted by now.

Or is it that everybody who mentioned this was overruled by middle&#x2F;upper management because they know better? What about the http:&#x2F;&#x2F; part?

      "A quick clarification on intent, since “browser automation” means different things to different people:<p>This isn’t about making scripts smarter or replacing Playwright&#x2F;Selenium. The problem I’m exploring is reliability: how to make agent-driven browser execution fail deterministically and explainably instead of half-working when layouts change.<p>Concretely, the agent doesn’t just “click and hope”. Each step is gated by explicit post-conditions, similar to how tests assert outcomes:<p>----\n## Python Code Example:<p>ready = runtime.assert_(\n    all_of(url_contains(&quot;checkout&quot;), exists(&quot;role=button&quot;)),\n    &quot;checkout_ready&quot;,\n    required=True\n)<p>----<p>If the condition isn’t met, the run stops with artifacts instead of drifting forward. Vision models are optional fallbacks, not the primary control signal.<p>Happy to answer questions about the design tradeoffs or where this approach falls short",
      "The shift from &quot;click and hope&quot; to explicit post-conditions is the right framing.<p>We&#x27;ve been building agent-based automation and the reliability problem is brutal. An agent can be 95% accurate on each step, but chain ten steps together and you&#x27;re at 60% success rate. That&#x27;s not usable.<p>Curious about the failure modes though. What happens when the verification itself is wrong? Like, the cart shows updated on screen but the verification layer checks a stale element?",
      "Does the browser expose its accessibility tree instead of the raw dom element tree? The accessibility tree should be enough, I mean, it&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed for vision impaired customers, and technically the ai agent _is_ a vision impaired customer. For a fair usage, try the accessibility tree.",
      "I have found that a hybrid viewport screenshot + textual &#x27;semantic snapshot&#x27; approach leads to the best outcomes, though sometimes text-only can be fine if the underlying page is not made of a complete mess of frameworks that would otherwise confuse normal click handlers, etc.<p>I think using a logical diff to do pass&#x2F;fail checking is clever, though I wonder if there are failure modes there that may confuse things, such as verifying highly dynamic webpages that change their content even without active user interactions.",
      "Great point about the accessibility tree @joeframbach. The &quot;vision impaired customer&quot; analogy is spot on - if an interface works for screen readers, it should work for AI agents.<p>What I find most compelling about this approach is the explicit verification layer. Too many browser automation projects fail silently or drift into unexpected states. The Jest-style assertions create a clear contract: either the step definitively succeeded or it didn&#x27;t, with artifacts for debugging.<p>This reminds me of property-based testing - instead of hoping the agent &quot;gets it right,&quot; you&#x27;re encoding what success actually looks like.",
      "I took a look at the quickstart with aim of running this locally and found that an API key is needed for the importance ranking.<p>What exactly is importance ranking? Does the verification layer still exists without this ranking?",
      "It is interesting subject matter, I am working on something similar. But the descriptions are quite terse. Maybe I just failed to gleam:<p>* When you &quot;run a WASM pass&quot;, how is that generated? Do you use an agent to do the pruning step, or is it deterministic?<p>* Where do the &quot;deterministic overrides&quot; come from? I assume they are generated by the verifier agent?",

I backed up the important stuff (I&#x27;d been using it less than a day) and created a new VM. That&#x27;s been the only hurdle so far.<p>Anyway, I haven&#x27;t used this, but thought it&#x27;d be useful to someone to hear that a related tool seems to be ok after ~five days of intermittent use. I&#x27;ve been an ESX (and recently Proxmox) fan in the past (and all the others cause I was curious), so I say this as someone who has kicked some VM rocks in my time.<p>As for locally run AI, this is the first time I&#x27;ve given one access to any data directly and I can&#x27;t speak intelligently about any of that or this specific tool.

      "&gt; And there are reasons to even be really bullish about AI’s long-run profitability — most notably, the sheer scale of value that AI could create. Many higher-ups at AI companies expect AI systems to outcompete humans across virtually all economically valuable tasks. If you truly believe that in your heart of hearts, that means potentially capturing trillions of dollars from labor automation. The resulting revenue growth could dwarf development costs even with thin margins and short model lifespans.<p>We keep seeing estimates like this repeated by AI companies and such. There is something that really irks me with it though, which is that it assumes companies that are replacing labor with LLMs are willing to pay as much as (or at least a significant fraction of) the labor costs they are replacing.<p>In practice, I haven&#x27;t seen that to be true anywhere. If Claude Code (for example) can replace 30% of a developers job, you would expect companies to be willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars per seat for it. Anecdotally at $WORK, we get nickel and dimed on dev tools (better for AI tools somewhat). I don&#x27;t expect corporate to suddenly accept to pay Anthropic 50k$ per developer even if they can lay off 1&#x2F;3 of us. Will anyone pay enough to realize the capture of &quot;trillion dollar&quot;?",
      "The Uber comparison is funny because they burned $32B over 14 years before profitability.  OpenAI alone is burning something like $10B&#x2F;year and growing, so the US AI labs are probably close to 10x Ubers burn rate.<p>Given the scale of AI lab burn rates being so high that the AI Capex shows up in nationwide economic stats, it clearly cannot burn for that long.<p>So what happens first - labs figure out how to get compute costs down by an order of magnitude, they add enough value to raise prices an order of magnitude (Uber), or some labs begin imploding?<p>Keep in mind another aspect of the comparison is that there wasn&#x27;t an entire supply chain spend effect triggered by Uber.  That is - you didn&#x27;t have new car companies building new factories to produce 10x more cars, new roads being built, new gas stations being built, etc the way you have for AI.<p>It&#x27;s like the entire economy has taken 1 giant correlated bet here.",
      "Framing GPT 5 as a loss because of its short run like that is a bit weird.  They say &quot;the R&amp;D that went into GPT-5 likely informs future models like GPT-6&quot;.  but that really understates what is happening here.<p>Barring solid evidence otherwise you would think that GPT 5.2  was built largely on GPT 5,  enough that possibly the majority of the cost of 5.2 was in developing GPT 5.<p>It would be like if you shipped something v1.0 on day one and discovered a bug and shipped something v1.01 the next day.   Then at the end of the year reported that v1.0 massively lost money but you wouldn&#x27;t believe the profit we made on v1.01 it was the single largest return on a single day of development we&#x27;ve ever seen.",
      "&gt; But we can still do an illustrative calculation: let’s conservatively assume that OpenAI started R&amp;D on GPT-5 after o3’s release last April. Then there’d still be four months between then and GPT-5’s release in August,20 during which OpenAI spent around $5 billion on R&amp;D. But that’s still higher than the $3 billion of gross profits. In other words, OpenAI spent more on R&amp;D in the four months preceding GPT-5, than it made in gross profits during GPT-5’s four-month tenure.<p>These numbers actually look really good. OpenAI&#x27;s revenue has been increasing 10x year-on-year since 2023, which means spending even 3x the amount of resources to produce another model next year would likely generate a healthy profit. The newer models are more efficient so inference costs tend to decrease as well.<p>As long as models can keep improving, and crucially if that depends on the amount of compute you put in them, OpenAI and other closed-source AI companies will succeed. If those two key assumptions stop being true, I can definitely see the whole castle of cards crumbling as open source competition will eat their lunch.",
