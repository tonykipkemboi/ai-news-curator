      "I&#x27;ve yet to be convinced by any article, including this one, that attempts to draw boxes around what coding agents are and aren&#x27;t good at in a way that is robust on a 6 to 12 month horizon.<p>I agree that the examples listed here are relatable, and I&#x27;ve seen similar in my uses of various coding harnesses, including, to some degree, ones driven by opus 4.5. But my general experience with using LLMs for development over the last few years has been that:<p>1. Initially models could at best assemble a simple procedural or compositional sequences of commands or functions to accomplish a basic goal, perhaps meeting tests or type checking, but with no overall coherence,<p>2. To being able to structure small functions reasonably,<p>3. To being able to structure large functions reasonably,<p>4. To being able to structure medium-sized files reasonably,<p>5. To being able to structure large files, and small multi-file subsystems, somewhat reasonably.<p>So the idea that they are now falling down on the multi-module or multi-file or multi-microservice level is both not particularly surprising to me and also both not particularly indicative of future performance. There is a hierarchy of scales at which abstraction can be applied, and it seems plausible to me that the march of capability improvement is a continuous push upwards in the scale at which agents can reasonably abstract code.<p>Alternatively, there could be that there is a legitimate discontinuity here, at which anything resembling current approaches will max out, but I don&#x27;t see strong evidence for it here.",
      "It&#x27;s just amazing to me how fast the goal posts are moving. Four years ago, if you had told someone that a LLM would be able to one-shot either of those first two tasks they would&#x27;ve said you&#x27;re crazy. The tech is moving <i>so fast</i>. I slept on Opus 4.5 because GPT 5 was kind of an air ball, and just started using it in the past few weeks. It&#x27;s so good. Way better than almost anything that&#x27;s come before it. It can one-shot tasks that we never would&#x27;ve considered possible before.",
      "&gt; Claude can’t create good abstractions on its own<p>LLMs definitely can create abstractions and boundaries. e.g. most will lean towards a pretty clean front end vs backend split even without hints. Or work out a data structure that fits the need. Or splits things into free standing modules. Or structure a plan into phases.<p>So this really just boils down to „good” abstractions which is subject to model improvement.<p>I really don’t see a durable moat for us meatbags in this line of reasoning",
      "In my experience Claude is like a &quot;good junior developer&quot; -- can do some things really well, FUBARS other things, but on the whole something to which tasks can be delegated if things are well explained.  If&#x2F;when it gets to the ability level of a mid-level engineer it will be revolutionary.  Typically a mid-level engineer can be relied upon to do the right thing with no&#x2F;minimal oversight, can figure out incomplete instructions, and deliver quality results (and even train up the juniors on some things).  At that point the only reason to have human junior engineers is so they can learn their way up the ladder to being an architect and responsible coordinating swarms of Claude Agents to develop whole applications and complete complex tasks and initiatives.<p>Beyond that what can Claude do... analyze the business and market as a whole and decide on product features, industry inefficiencies, gap analysis, and then define projects to address those and coordinate fleets of agents to change or even radically pivot an entire business?<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get to the point where all you have is a CEO and a massive Claude account but it&#x27;s not completely science fiction the more I think about it.",
      "LLMs are just really good search. Ask it to create something and it&#x27;s searching within the pretrained weights. Ask it to find something and it&#x27;s semantically searching within your codebase. Ask it to modify something and it will do both. Once you understand its just search, you can get really good results.",
      "Yeah, that&#x27;s my current gripe but I think this just needs some good examples in AGENTS.md (I&#x27;ve done some for hooks and it kinda works but need to remind it). I need good AGENTS.md that explain what good abstraction boundary is and how to define is the problem is I am not sure I know how to put it into words, if anyone has idea please let me know.",
      "I am making an app in Elixir.<p>100% of code is made by Claude.<p>It is damn good at making &quot;blocks&quot;.<p>However, Elixir seems to be a langage that works very well for LLM, cf. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elixirforum.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;llm-coding-benchmark-by-language&#x2F;72634\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elixirforum.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;llm-coding-benchmark-by-language&#x2F;7...</a>",
      "By and large, I agree with the article. Claude is great and fast at doing low level dev work. Getting the syntax right in some complicated mechanism, executing an edit-execute-readlog loop, making multi file edits.<p>This is exactly why I love it. It&#x27;s smart enough to do my donkey work.<p>I&#x27;ve revisited the idea that typing speed doesn&#x27;t matter for programmers. I think it&#x27;s still an odd thing to judge a candidate on, but appreciate it in another way now. Being able to type quickly and accurately reduces frustration, and people who foresee less frustration are more likely to try the thing they are thinking about.<p>With LLMs, I have been able to try so many things that I never tried before. I feel that I&#x27;m learning faster because I&#x27;m not tripping over silly little things.",
      "This mirrors my experience trying to integrate LLMs into production pipelines.<p>The issue seems to be that LLMs treat code as a literary exercise rather than a graph problem. Claude is fantastic at the syntax and local logic (&#x27;assembling blocks&#x27;), but it lacks the persistent global state required to understand how a change in module A implicitly breaks a constraint in module Z.<p>Until we stop treating coding agents as &#x27;text predictors&#x27; and start grounding them in an actual AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) or dependency graph, they will remain helpful juniors rather than architects.",
      "I&#x27;m not entirely convinced by the anecdote here where Claude wrote &quot;bad&quot; React code:<p>&gt; But in context, this was obviously insane. I knew that key and id came from the same upstream source. So the correct solution was to have the upstream source also pass id to the code that had key, to let it do a fast lookup.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Claude make mistakes like that too, but then the moment you say &quot;you can modify the calling code as well&quot; or even ask &quot;any way we could do this better?&quot; it suggests the optimal solution.<p>My guess is that Claude is trained to bias towards making minimal edits to solve problems. This is a desirable property, because six months ago a common complaint about LLMs is that you&#x27;d ask for a small change and they would rewrite dozens of additional lines of code.<p>I expect that adding a CLAUDE.md rule saying &quot;always look for more efficient implementations that might involve larger changes and propose those to the user for their confirmation if appropriate&quot; might solve the author&#x27;s complaint here."

      "Breaking this down, several of AWS&#x27;s core repos like the JS SDK use an allowlist of which contributor ids can run workflow actions in their PRs.  The list was a regex, contained several short ids, and wasn&#x27;t anchored with ^$, so if it allowed user 12345, then any userid <i>containing</i> 12345 could run their own actions on the PR, including one that exfiltrated access tokens.  So they spammed GH with user creation requests, got an id that matched, and they were in like Flynn.<p>Said tokens didn&#x27;t have admin access, but had enough privileges to invite other users to become full admins.  Not sure if they were rotated, but github tokens are usually long-lived, like up to a year.  Hey, isn&#x27;t AWS the one always lecturing us to use temporary credentials?  To be fair, AWS did more than just fix the regex, they introduced an &quot;approve workflow run&quot; UI unto the PR process that I think GH is also using now (not sure about that).",

Each step had an explicit goal, explicit inputs, and a defined end. Once the step finished, the agent stopped and context was rebuilt deliberately.<p>Harnesses like this feel important because they shift the problem from “make the model smarter” to “make the system more predictable.” In our experience, reliability came more from reducing degrees of freedom than from adding intelligence.",

They were so bad they would work in questions casually to their actual work.<p>I started avoiding all of them when I found out management had been dumping on my team and praising theirs. It’s just such a slap in the face because they could not have done well and their implementation was horrible.",
      "&gt; It’s important to point out that for much of the lifecycle of a project, whether it’s “bad” is highly subjective.<p>I can’t emphasize this part enough.<p>I’ve been part of some projects where someone external to the team went on a crusade to shut our work down because they disagreed with it. When we pushed through, shipped it, and it worked well they lost a lot of credibility.<p>Be careful about what you spend your reputational capital on.",
      "I think this advice is pretty apt for small to medium sized companies. We&#x27;re all invested in the company succeeding, but you don&#x27;t want to become known as the person that always says &quot;no&quot;.<p>At large companies, I&#x27;ve rarely found a reason to speak out on a project. Unless it has a considerable effect on my team&#x2F;work (read: peace of mind), it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to be the person casting doubt. There&#x27;s not much ROI for being &quot;right&quot;.<p>If you manage to kill the project before it starts, no one will ever know how bad of a disaster you prevented. If the project succeeds despite your objections, you look like an idiot. And if it fails - as the author notes, that doesn&#x27;t get remembered either.<p>As a senior IC, the only real ROI I&#x27;ve found in these situations is when you can have a solution handy if things fail. People <i>love</i> a fixer. Even if you only manage to pull this off once or twice, your perception in the org&#x2F;company gets a massive boost. <i>&quot;Wow, so-and-so is always thinking ahead.&quot;</i><p>A basic example I saw at my last company was automated E2E testing in production. My teammate had suggested this to improve our ability to detect regressions, but it was ultimately shot down as not being worth the investment over other features.<p>A few months later, we had seen multiple instances of users hitting significant issues before we could catch them. My teammate was able to whip out the test framework they had been building on the side, and was immediately showered with praise&#x2F;organizational support (and I&#x27;m sure a great review as well).",

At the same time, you also shouldn’t take on the emotional burden of other people’s projects.<p>If I see something heading toward failure, I let people know they may want to consider a different approach. That’s it. There’s no need to be harsh or belabor the point but it’s better to speak up than to quietly watch a train wreck unfold.",
      "The dynamics are exactly right, but I would say engineers can&#x27;t &quot;let&quot; &quot;politically bad&quot; projects fail, because fixing that is, in a very real sense, above their paygrade. That responsibility lies with the executives.<p>The engineers&#x27; role should mostly be as technical advisors, i.e. calling out bad projects for technical reasons (UX, architecture, etc.) But even the seniormost engineers do not have the corporate standing, let alone political cachet, to call out or fix political issues (empire building, infighting between orgs, etc.) They can and should point out these conflicts to leadership (very diplomatically, of course) but should bear no responsibility for the outcomes.<p>However, as an engineer you should ABSOLUTELY be aware of these dynamics because they <i>will</i> impact your career. Like when the project is canceled with no impact delivered.<p>The example given of the latent turf war between the product and platform teams might have been avoided via a very clear mandate from senior leadership about who owns what exactly. This would probably have involved some horse-trading about what the org giving up its turf gets in return. (BTW if you&#x27;ve ever wondered &quot;Why so many re-orgs&quot; this is why.) That this didn&#x27;t happen is a failure on the execs&#x27; part.<p>As an aside, I know this happens in every large company, but somehow it appears to be a lot more common at Google? Or at least Googlers are more open about it. E.g. I observed something similar on that recent post about lessions from Google: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46488819\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46488819</a>",

This is organizational gangrene described from the inside and partly how or why it happens. If you are leading an organization and reading this - figure out how to measure and prevent it.",
      "Great analogy.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked at a company as large as Google but in my experience things can be a little more optimistic than the post.

It doesn&#x27;t have to be a &quot;$50,000 check&quot; every time.<p>That leads to a very important question - Why doesn&#x27;t leadership always trust their engineers? And there&#x27;s a very important answer that isn&#x27;t mentioned in the blog post - Sometimes the engineers are wrong.<p>Engineers are extremely good at finding flaws. But not so good at understanding the business perspective. Depending on the greater context there are times where it does make sense to move forward with a flawed idea.<p>So next time you hear an idea that sounds stupid, take a beat to understand more where the idea is coming from.

      "I just finished deploying the unified Ai landscaping dashboard for Hadaa Ai. This allows you to easily switch Ai modes like style presets, typing your own text prompts and even the advanced Auto Fix tool which detects design improvements that can be done on your space.",
      "Easier to just use your preferred llm with image editing capabilities. Nano banana was better than any tool I found when I used AI to come up with landscaping visualizations.",
      "We had a few trees fall in our backyard last year and one of the first things I did was throw a picture into Photoshop for its generative fill tool. I removed the fallen trees, then added some raised garden beds and a gazebo (for good measure).<p>I&#x27;ll play around with the tool a bit later, as the above is an idea I have for a homework assignment. I&#x27;d be happy to chat off HN about some of the ways this type of tool would be super beneficial for landscapers&#x2F;engineers.",
      "I&#x27;d love to see Screenshots or video of the brushing. I&#x27;ve found nanobanana difficult to control with, eg markings and highlighter.",
      "This is really cool, and I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to do this with the home renovations&#x2F; construction side of things.<p>Might be something to look into."
