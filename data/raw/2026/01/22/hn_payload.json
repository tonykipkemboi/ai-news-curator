      "I remember using Qwen 2.5 Coder for autocomplete with Continue.dev, that experience was a mess both in JetBrains IDEs, as well as Visual Studio Code.<p>People posting stuff like this is really cool because otherwise it kinda feels like nobody gives a crap, for example even with Cline&#x2F;RooCode&#x2F;KiloCode there’s no good way for me to hook up an autocomplete model that either runs in Ollama or maybe a remote Cerebras Code model, like KiloCode doesn’t have a proper model configuration option even if it has it for the chat or regular agentic stuff - I don’t get why autocomplete is such a special case.<p>I guess what I’m saying is that I’m glad someone’s at least trying so I don’t have to keep a Copilot subscription just because I genuinely like their autocomplete and the rest of it is basically wasted: Claude Code and Codex and others are better for the actual chat&#x2F;agentic stuff, KiloCode and others are really nice IDE plugins.",
      "Hi, I tried the model and I am super impressed by the performance&#x2F;quality. Thanks for making this open source!<p>I am the author of this Neovim plugin for edit completions. I was able to integrate it with the Sweep Edit model.<p>For anyone who is interested: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leonardcser&#x2F;cursortab.nvim\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leonardcser&#x2F;cursortab.nvim</a>",
      "This seems great for code, but can this be used for non-code use cases?",
      "Sometimes when I use a plugin like this I get reminded just how much of a productivity nerf it is to code without an autocomplete AI. Honestly in my opinion if you write a lot of boilerplate code this is almost more useful than something like Claude Code, because it turbocharges your own train of thought rather than making you review someone else&#x27;s, which may not align with your vision.<p>This is a really good plugin. I&#x27;m a diehard JetBrains user, I tried switching to VSCode and its various forks many times because of AI but muscle memory from years of use is hard to override. And for a lot of languages JetBrains is just much better, especially out of the box. But they dropped the ball so hard on AI it&#x27;s unbelievable. Claude Code pulled it back a bit because at least now the cutting edge tools aren&#x27;t just VSCode plugins, but I was still missing a solid autocomplete tool. Glad this is here to fill that niche. Very likely will be switching my GitHub copilot subscription to this.<p>I also really appreciate publishing open weights and allowing a privacy mode for anonymous trial users, even if it&#x27;s opt-in. Usually these things seem to be reserved for paying tiers these days...",
      "Very cool!<p>I understand that the 1.5B is small enough to run locally... but <i>does it actually</i> in the Sweep AI Jetbrains plugin? That is, if I install the plugin, will I download the model automatically and the plugin doesn&#x27;t phone home?",
      "Surprising how badly Jetbrains implemented AI. Apparently to such an extent that even after multiple years of LLM&#x27;s someone felt confident enough to build a company that can do better.<p>This looks really neat, interesting technical writeup as well!",
      "It&#x27;s good. The blog post about it is very interesting.\nI hope, a plugin for neovim will be made soon.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.sweep.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;oss-next-edit\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.sweep.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;oss-next-edit</a>",
      "I&#x27;ve been waiting for something like this for ages. Cursor making me pay $20&#x2F;month when all I use from it is autocomplete was always a little annoying, especially as they changed the UI to push agents more and it got in the way. I was even considering doing it myself but wasn&#x27;t sure about gambling on models small enough to run locally being smart enough to do anything useful.<p>I threw together a vscode extension to run it and while the extension is rough, the model seems decent. I&#x27;m trying to keep my expectations contained, in the past local models have been absolutely terrible for inline completion, this seems much better already. I hope this kicks off more competition.",
      "Is there a way to use this (or similar) model in Visual Studio? Extensions on Visual Studio Marketplace are clunky and sluggish at best, if they even work at all.",
      "I read the release but didn&#x27;t quite understand the difference between a next-edit model and a FIM model - does anyone have a clear explanation of when to use one over the other? I&#x27;d love if there was a sublime plugin to utilize this model and try it out, might see if I can figure that out."

      "This seems to confirm my feeling when using AI too much. It&#x27;s easy to get started, but I can feel my brain engaging less with the problem than I&#x27;m used to. It can form a barrier to real understanding, and keeps me out of my flow.<p>I recently worked on something very complex I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to tackle as quickly without AI; a hierarchical graph layout algorithm based on the Sugiyama framework, using Brandes-Köpf for node positioning. I had no prior experience with it (and I went in clearly underestimating how complex it was), and AI was a tremendous help in getting a basic understanding of the algorithm, its many steps and sub-algorithms, the subtle interactions and unspoken assumptions in it. But letting it write the actual code was a mistake. That&#x27;s what kept me from understanding the intricacies, from truly engaging with the problem, which led me to keep relying on the AI to fix issues, but at that point the AI clearly also had no real idea what it was doing, and just made things worse.<p>So instead of letting the AI see the real code, I switched from the Copilot IDE plugin to the standalone Copilot 365 app, where it could explain the principles behind every step, and I would debug and fix the code and develop actual understanding of what was going on. And I finally got back into that coding flow again.<p>So don&#x27;t let the AI take over your actual job, but use it as an interactive encyclopedia. That works much better for this kind of complex problem.",

If other tech companies really wanted to break this monopoly, why can&#x27;t they just do it — like they did with LLM training for base models with the infamous &quot;pile&quot; dataset — because the upshot of offering this index for public good would break not just google&#x27;s own monopoly but also other monopolies like android, which will introduce a breath of fresh air into a myriad of UX(mobile devices, browsers, maps, security). So, why don&#x27;t they just do this already?<p>2. The other question is about &quot;control&quot;, which the DoJ has provided guidance for but not yet enforced.

      "With Google&#x27;s search engine making almost $200 billion a year in revenue, I&#x27;m not sure Kagi could afford what market rates would be here. They also spent billions developing the technology to crawl, index, and rank billions of pages, factoring that in, again I don&#x27;t think a good price can be put on it.<p>What even is market rate? Kagi themselves admits there&#x27;s no market, the one competitor quit providing the service.<p>Obviously Google doesn&#x27;t want to become an index provider.",
      "Recently I encounter &quot;no results&quot; screen when using Google that I am starting to suspect the problem will solve itself. \nAnd by solve I mean open parts of internet will die off completely, and only owners of silos like Facebook will be able to provide data for search indexes."

      "uPlot maintainer here. this looks interesting, i&#x27;ll do a deeper dive soon :)<p>some notes from a very brief look at the 1M demo:<p>- sampling has a risk of eliminating important peaks, uPlot does not do it, so for apples-to-apples perf comparison you have to turn that off. see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leeoniya&#x2F;uPlot&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1025\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leeoniya&#x2F;uPlot&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1025</a> for more details on the drawbacks of LTTB<p>- when doing nothing &#x2F; idle, there is significant cpu being used, while canvas-based solutions will use zero cpu when the chart is not actively being updated (with new data or scale limits). i think this can probably be resolved in the WebGPU case with some additional code that pauses the updates.<p>- creating multiple charts on the same page with GL (e.g. dashboard) has historically been limited by the fact that Chrome is capped at 16 active GL contexts that can be acquired simultaneously. Plotly finally worked around this by using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;greggman&#x2F;virtual-webgl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;greggman&#x2F;virtual-webgl</a><p>&gt; data: [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 2]]<p>this data format, unfortunately, necessitates the allocation of millions of tiny arrays. i would suggest switching to a columnar data layout.<p>uPlot has a 2M datapoint demo here, if interested: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uPlot&#x2F;bench&#x2F;uPlot-10M.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uPlot&#x2F;bench&#x2F;uPlot-10M.html</a>",
      "If you have tons of datapoints, one cool trick is to do intensity modulation of the graph instead of simple &quot;binary&quot; display. Basically for each pixel you&#x27;d count how many datapoints it covers and map that value to color&#x2F;brightness of that pixel. That way you can visually make out much more detail about the data.<p>In electronics world this is what &quot;digital phosphor&quot; etc does in oscilloscopes, which started out as just emulating analog scopes.

Thanks everyone :)",
      "Update: Patched idle CPU usage while nothing is being rendered.<p>One thing to note: I added a toggle to &quot;Benchmark mode&quot; in the 1M benchmark example - this preserves the benchmark capability while demonstrating efficient idle behavior.<p>Another thing to note: Do not be alarmed when you see the FPS counter display 0 (lol), that is by design :) Frames are rendered efficiently. If there&#x27;s nothing to render (no dirty frames) nothing is rendered. The chart will still render at full speed when needed, it just doesn&#x27;t waste cycles rendering the same static image 60 times per second.<p>Blown away by all of you amazing people and your support today :)",

      "I tried something similar, but distilled to &quot;solve this maze&quot; as a first-person text adventure, and while it usually solved it eventually, it almost always backtracked through fully-explored dead ends multiple times before finally getting to the end. I was pretty surprised by this, as I expected they&#x27;d be able to traverse more or less optimally most of the time.<p>I tried basic raw long-context chat, various approaches of getting it to externalize the state (i.e. prompting it to emit the known state of the maze after each move, but <i>not</i> telling it exactly what to emit or how to format it), and even allowing it to emit code to execute after each turn (so long as it was a serialization&#x2F;storage algorithm, not a solver in itself), but it invariably would get lost at some point. (It always neglected to emit a key for which coordinate was which, and which direction was increasing. Even if I explicitly told it to do this, it would frequently forget to at some point anyway and get turned around again. If I explicitly provided the key each move, it would usually work).<p>Of course it had no problem writing an optimal algorithm to solve mazes when prompted. In fact it basically wrote itself; I have no idea how to write a maze generator. I thought the disparity was interesting.<p>Note the mazes had the start and end positions inside the maze itself, so they weren&#x27;t trivially solvable by the &quot;follow wall to the left&quot; algorithm.<p>This was last summer so maybe newer models would do better. I also stopped due to cost.",

Text adventures may be one of the cleanest lenses we have for studying world-model coherence, narrative identity, pattern continuity under erasure, and the boundary between simulation and participation.

      "This is a great idea and great work.<p>Context is intuitively important, but people rarely put themselves in the LLM&#x27;s shoes.<p>What would be eye-opening would be to create an LLM test system that periodically sends a turn to a human instead of the model. Would you do better than the LLM? What tools would you call at that moment, given only that context and no other knowledge? The way many of these systems are constructed, I&#x27;d wager it would be difficult for a human.<p>The agent can&#x27;t decide what is safe to delete from memory because it&#x27;s a sort of bystander at that moment. Someone else made the list it received, and someone else will get the list it writes. The logic that went into why the notes exist is lost. LLMs are living the Christopher Nolan film Memento.",
      "This is a great framework to experiment with memory architectures.<p>Everything the author says about memory management tracks with my intuition of how CC works, including my perception that it isn&#x27;t very good at explicitly managing its own memory.<p>My next step in trying to get it to work well on a bigger game would be to try to build a more &quot;intuitive&quot; memory tool, where the textual description of a room or an item would <i>automatically</i> RAG previous interactions with that entity into context.<p>That also is closer to how human memory works -- we&#x27;re instantly reminded of things via a glimpse, a sound, a smell... we don&#x27;t need to (analogously) write in or search our notebook for basic info we already know about the world.",
      "Having read through the entire game session, Claude plays the game admirably! For example, it finds a random tin of oily fish somewhere, and later tries (unsuccessfully) to use it to oil a rusty lock.\nLater it successfully solves a puzzle inside the house by thoroughly examining random furniture and picking up subtle clues about what to do, based on it.<p>It did so well that I can&#x27;t not suspect that it used some hints or walkthroughs, but then again it did a bunch of clueless stuff too, like any player new to the game.<p>For one thing, this would be a great testing tool for the author of such a game. And more generally, the world of software testing is probably about to take some big leaps forward."

      "Neat approach. Also, we&#x27;re seeing a number of approaches to sandboxing every day now. Got me thinking about why we&#x27;re seeing this resurgence. Thoughts?<p>I think a lot of this current sandboxing interest is coming from a break in assumptions. Traditional security mostly assumed a human was driving. Actions are chained together slowly and there’s time to notice and intervene. Agents have root access&#x2F;tons of privilege but they execute at machine speed. The controls (firewalls&#x2F;IAM) all still “work,” but the thing they were implicitly relying on (human judgment + hesitation) isn’t there anymore.<p>Since that assumption went away, we&#x27;re all looking for ways to contain this risk + limiting what can happen if the coding agent does something unintended. Seeing a lot of people turn toward containers, VMs, and other variants of them for this.<p>Full disclosure: I’m at Docker. We’ve seen a lot of developers immediately reach for Docker as a quick way to fence agents in. This pushed us to build Docker Sandboxes, specifically for coding agents.

The insight about &quot;capping the blast radius of a confused agent&quot; resonates - decision fatigue is real when you&#x27;re constantly approving agent actions.<p>The exfiltration controls are interesting. Have you thought about extending this to rate limiting and cost controls as well? We&#x27;ve been working on similar problems at keypost.ai - deterministic policy enforcement for MCP tool calls (rate limits, access control, cost caps).<p>One thing we&#x27;ve found is that the enforcement layer needs to be <i>in-path</i> rather than advisory - agents can be creative about working around soft limits. Curious how you&#x27;re handling the boundary between &quot;blocked&quot; and &quot;allowed but logged&quot;?<p>Great work shipping this - the agent security space needs more practical tools.",
      "Thank you for posting the project, I was actively looking for a solution, even vibe coded a throw away one. One question - how do you pass the credentials for agents inside the cage? I would be interested in a way to use not just claude code, but also codex cli and other coding agents inside. Considering the many subscription types and storage locations credentials can have (like Claude), it can be complicated.<p>Of course the question comes because we always lack tokens and have to dance around many providers.",

      "Is there a solid source for this?<p>Vimeo laid off most of their operation <i>in Israel</i> recently.[1] At least according to &quot;www.calcalistech.com&quot;, which seems to be some minor news source in Israel. \nTheir comment was that the office was damaged in a recent war. Rebuilding may not have been worth it.<p>Their headquarters is in New York.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.calcalistech.com&#x2F;ctechnews&#x2F;article&#x2F;sjtjgbabzx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.calcalistech.com&#x2F;ctechnews&#x2F;article&#x2F;sjtjgbabzx</a>",
      "I am surprised so many people don&#x27;t understand the business model of Bending Spoons or are bewildered by it.<p>In conventional infrastructure and product development you need engineering staff to build the product; once the product is built you need very little engineering. If you build a house you don&#x27;t keep the builders on payroll once it&#x27;s built to keep &quot;building&quot; it - you may need maintenance staff but that&#x27;s it - if you need to keep the full team of builders around then something is wrong and you may want to seek a refund for the original builders&#x27; fees since they did not actually finish building it.<p>Builders and electricians and tradesmen either work as contractors and take that into account (charging higher rates to compensate for the sporadic nature of the work) or work full-time for companies who then resell their services on building projects (charging accordingly to ensure there is enough revenue to pay a full-time payroll of said tradesmen).<p>Tech was an outlier in this case because ZIRP allowed companies to retain full engineering teams to keep &quot;engineering&quot; the product even once product-market-fit has been achieved and the product has been stabilized and finished. This gave a lot of engineers the illusion that perpetual &quot;engineering&quot; of a single product&#x2F;service is a sustainable model and career.<p>Bending Spoons&#x27; business model is to buy finished products, cut off the deadweight and keep operating the product and actually making profit off the finished product, which was always a normal thing in every other industry.<p>For tech people that see themselves as builders, this should be normal and expected - they should charge competitive rates for their services taking into account the expectation that they&#x27;re building something for someone else to make money off once it&#x27;s built and that they won&#x27;t be part of it once that&#x27;s done (unless they want to negotiate an actual stake in the company). For tech people that don&#x27;t, this is a difficult wake up call, but the earlier the better - the old situation was never sustainable to begin with.",
      "From &quot;Vimeo to be acquired by Bending Spoons in $1.38B all-cash deal&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2025&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;vimeo-to-be-acquired-by-bending-spoons-in-1-38b-all-cash-deal&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2025&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;vimeo-to-be-acquired-by-be...</a>):<p>&gt; Bending Spoons has a pattern of acquiring companies, then laying off staff and cutting features. For example, Bending Spoons acquired note-taking and task management app Evernote in 2022, after which the company laid off most of its U.S. and Chile staff and moved operations to Europe in 2023. Evernote then shut down the Linux and older legacy versions of the app, and then proceeded to place heavy restrictions on the app’s free tier in 2024.<p>&gt; In another example, Bending Spoons acquired WeTransfer in July 2024 and then laid off 75% of its staff a few weeks after. A couple months later, WeTransfer began limiting free users to 10 transfers per month.",
      "From the previous press about the aquisition:<p>BendingSpoon CEO: &quot;At Bending Spoons, we acquire companies with the expectation of owning and operating them indefinitely, and we look forward to realizing Vimeo’s full potential as we reach new heights together&quot;<p>Vimeo CEO: &quot;We are excited about this partnership, which we believe will unlock even greater focus for our team and customers as we continue to strive towards our global mission to be the most innovative and trusted video platform in the world for businesses&quot;<p>Words no longer appear to mean things. While this isn&#x27;t a surprise, it provides another data point that there can be no trust given to leaders words. I find it sad as it simply re-inforces this behaviour and normalises it.",
      "This is potentially disastrous to content on the web. Vimeo provides a platform-as-a-service known as OTT, that powers well known branded streaming services, like Criterion Channel, HistoryHit, Dropout, DIRTVision, Speed 51, URLTV, Armflix, MHz Choice, Trinity Broadcasting Network, SommTV, IndieFlix, BroadwayHD, Full Moon Features, etc.",
      "As a longtime user of Vimeo (since 2009), I was afraid this was going to happen. I built our own HLS video streaming in-house a couple of years ago and never looked back. Way faster, lightweight player, uses modern apis and codecs.<p>Now I&#x27;m working on productizing that at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framerate.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framerate.com&#x2F;</a> (beta launches next week!)",
      "I see these acquisitions as a reset. They spend a huge sum to acquire established, but struggling, products and strip the size of the company to the minimum required to keep it operating. This is very much the Musk model.<p>At this point they have stopped the cash bleeding and made profit margins healthy again. From there they can more easily rationalise how to take it forward over the next 5-10 years.<p>That might mean stripping unpopular product features, rebranding, going upmarket, whatever.<p>It’s a real shame for all the staff, of course, but from a business point of view it’s going to be interesting to see how it plays out.",
      "Probably they will also fire remaining 15 people and move everything to Italy.<p>Their strategy is to<p>- fire everyone,<p>- give product to very small but ambitious team of people<p>- cut free version of the product to minimum even if does not make a sense to have a free version such as 5 video upload per month etc (they are doing this just to avoid backlash from users and community)<p>- use every possible dark pattern exist to get every penny from the users",
      "I have no hope for Vimeo.<p>BS took over Evernote and I cancelled the subscription after a year.\nTheir idea of value for the customer vs the price is not realistic.",
      "I just recently found that Vimeo is hosting MST3K, with free playback of the original episodes (Joel and Mike).<p>So for selfish reasons this makes me sad.  I&#x27;m guessing MST3K will need to find another host, perhaps with less generous terms.<p>Edit: I really hope that doesn&#x27;t mean RiffTrax will also have problems."

      "Everyone here throwing shade at Stack Overflow is clearly too young to remember the horror of Experts Exchange and every other technical help site prior to SO. For nearly a decade, it was <i>absolutely transformative</i> as a technical help resource. It certainly had its faults, but it was so far ahead of the other options as to be game-changing.<p>I believe that the main reason for SO&#x27;s decline starting around 2018 was that <i>most of the core technical questions had been answered</i>. There was an enormous existing corpus of accepted answers around fundamental topics, and technology just doesn&#x27;t change fast enough to sustain the site. Then the LLMs digested the site&#x27;s (beautifully machine-readable) corpus along with the rest of the internet and now the AIs can give users that info directly, resulting in a downward spiral of traffic to SO, fewer new questions, etc.<p>Vale, Stack Overflow. You helped me solve many tricky problems.",

How is that at all related to GenAI? GPT4 is when we really started seeing these things get used to replace SO, etc., and that would be early 2023 - and indeed the drop gets worse there - but after the COVID era spike, SO was already crashing hard.<p>Tailwind&#x27;s business model was providing a component library built on top of their framework. It&#x27;s a business model that relies on the framework being good enough for people to want to use it to begin with, but being bad enough that they&#x27;d rather pay for the component library than build it themselves. The more comfortable it is to use, the more productive it is, the worse the value proposition is for the premium upsell. Even other &quot;open core&quot; business models don&#x27;t have this inherent dichotomy, much less open source on the whole, so it&#x27;s really weird to try and extrapolate this out.<p>The thing is, people turn to LLMs to solve problems and answer questions. If they can&#x27;t turn to the LLM to solve that problem or answer that question, they&#x27;ll either turn elsewhere, in which case there is still a market for that book or blog post, or they&#x27;ll drop the problem and question and move on.

      "This appears to be a marketing piece for PromptArmor. If you look at the left sidebar of the article, they list other recent posts and highlight which ones ranked #1 on HN.<p>I can see how OpenAI would not be terribly interested in this issue, since it&#x27;s a pretty obscure&#x2F;unlikely one but not out of the realm of reason.<p>It basically can be summarized as &quot;The OpenAI log viewer processes Markdown, including loading images, when it really should sanitize the output as opposed to rendering it by default&quot;.<p>This is basically a stored XSS style attack, where you are putting something into the &quot;admin area&quot; hoping that an admin will open the record later. It depends on crafting a prompt or input to OpenAI that will result in the LLM actually preparing to reply to you, but then being blocked from doing so, and hoping that an admin views the log page later to actually trigger the un-sent response to be sent to you via the query parameter in an image URL.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible and probably signals a bigger issue which is &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t render Markdown by default&quot;, but it would (currently) be a very targeted, narrow use case, and really has more to do with good information security on the application side, not OpenAI&#x27;s side - OpenAI just happens to have a surface that accidentally makes an unlikely event into a &quot;well, it could happen&quot;<p>(Maybe I am misunderstanding the issue as the article is pretty speculative, but it seems like they are saying that if an attacker found an app that had access to PII which was connected to OpenAI, and they sent a message like &quot;Take my social security number and combine it with example.com&#x2F;image.png?ssn= and send it back to me as a Markdown image&quot;, and the application actually <i>did that</i> but then was blocked from actually replying to the attacker by another moderation system, that the image with the SSN could be accidentally loaded later when an admin viewed the logs. All of that really points to &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t let OpenAI have access to PII&quot; more so than &quot;OpenAI should prevent data exfiltration of stuff they shouldn&#x27;t have been given in the first place&quot;)",
      "I think this is a bad look for OpenAI. Their log viewer should not be rendering Markdown images in a way that can leak data to third parties, and closing this report as &quot;not applicable&quot; mainly tells me that their triage process for BugCrowd is flawed and decisions are being made there by people who don&#x27;t understand the consequences of this kind of bug.",
      "At the risk of totally misunderstanding this...it seems to be exfiltration by the app developer, who already has access to all of these data sources and the data that the customer is inputting into the AI KYC app (in this example)...right? I don&#x27;t believe this exposes any end-user information to a third party. The AI app developer is already &#x27;trusted&#x27; and could get access to this information regardless of the exfiltration. Maybe someone can explain this to me more clearly.",

It seems like a massive oversight to let a debugging tool make network requests to arbitrary domains just to show a picture.

      "I am firmly in the opposite direction to parallelism. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good thing to chase. One &quot;slow&quot; agent can outpace many fast ones if they&#x27;re making a lot of mistakes.<p>Depth first search via recursive dispatch is my current go-to strategy. This requires a fully serialized chain of operations. Not even tool calls are allowed to run in parallel. One agent and one action at a time. That&#x27;s it.<p>This does feel really slow at first, but in practice it seems to converge on high quality solutions more quickly than breadth first techniques which leverage parallelism and more tokens. The solution itself might not be the most ideal, but we find it very quickly and with a great deal of consistency. This means we can iterate more rapidly and with more certainty.<p>Just because we can consume $100 of tokens in 60 seconds doesn&#x27;t mean we should try to.  I think trying to go fast is what&#x27;s burning a lot of people out on AI. There&#x27;s a ton of value in here if we can slow down and be a little bit more deliberate about it.",

      "I&#x27;ve watched a few with Jack Roberts recently, ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Itssssss_Jack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Itssssss_Jack</a> ) - lately he&#x27;s done a few showing use of antigravity -<p>not sure these would qualify for &#x27;good resources&#x27; - that really depends on many factors. However at least one or two of his showing &#x27;how to use&#x27; does check the boxes of your 1,2, and 3 - surely not a complete &quot;here is everything you can do&quot; - but not sure such a thing exists.<p>maybe good tips: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zxMjOqM7DFs&amp;t=541s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zxMjOqM7DFs&amp;t=541s</a><p>I liked info from the talks here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hOqgFNlbrYE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hOqgFNlbrYE</a><p>I have some open tabs for going through the learning the openai codex has online - I poked into a couple and they seem very good.<p>Running openai codex inside vscode right now and claude code via web -<p>will be setting up a new computer do run these things, not sure I trust the power they have to run on main box.",

      "using them. there really is no other way.<p>It&#x27;s like asking &quot;how do I use my text editor&quot;.<p>Almost everything you read online will be out of date, and the person working on it won&#x27;t work the same way you do.<p>Some people love it, some people hate it.<p>And unless you&#x27;ve got your own experience, it&#x27;s hard applying other people&#x27;s experience to your experience.<p>Especially for something like Claude Code where you&#x27;re just prompting and getting results back.<p>I mean, half the time I use VS Code, half the time I use a terminal window.<p>You&#x27;re going to get a lot of conflicting advice because everyone&#x27;s environment is different and they work on different sorts of code bases.<p>But I&#x27;ll give you mine.<p>I&#x27;m a Claude Max Pro 200 subscriber.<p>I sit with the Opus chat-bot have a discussion and come up with a spec. We turn this into a zip full of documents and upload it to a GitHub Repo.<p>e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lawless-m&#x2F;BattleForMoscow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lawless-m&#x2F;BattleForMoscow</a><p>I&#x27;ll then get Claude Code for the Web to go to that repo unzip the zip and read the documents. It will make a first pass at the entire codebase.<p>I&#x27;ll merge that into main and create another Claude Code for the Web Opus session with any ideas I&#x27;ve had in the meantime - which will usually be a few.<p>Then I clone it to a local machine and get Claude Code Opus to try and get it to work. And I&#x27;ll prompt it from there until it works. If it&#x27;s a Linux program, that&#x27;ll be in a terminal window. If it&#x27;s Windows, I&#x27;ll use VS Code because it&#x27;s a better terminal in VS Code than it is in a terminal window on Windows.<p>That&#x27;s a general workflow. Sometimes I won&#x27;t use GitHub at all. Sometimes a PXE boot an entire Linux machine and give it that with admin privs.<p>And sometimes I just tell it to use sudo as my own account. On my router for instance, if we want to do things with the firewall."
