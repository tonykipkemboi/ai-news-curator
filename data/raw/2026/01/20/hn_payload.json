      "At this point, I am starting to feel like we don’t need new languages, but new ways to create specifications.<p>I have a hypothesis that an LLM can act as a pseudocode to code translator, where the pseudocode can tolerate a mixture of code-like and natural language specification. The benefit being that it formalizes the human as the specifier (which must be done anyway) and the llm as the code writer. This also might enable lower resource “non-frontier” models to be more useful. Additionally, it allows tolerance to syntax mistakes or in the worst case, natural language if needed.<p>In other words, I think llms don’t need new languages, we do.",
      "Developed by Jordan Hubbard of NVIDIA (and FreeBSD).<p>My understanding&#x2F;experience is that LLM performance in a language scales with how well the language is represented in the training data.<p>From that assumption, we might expect LLMs to actually do better with an existing language for which more training code is available, even if that language is more complex and seems like it should be “harder” to understand.",
      "I went looking for a single Markdown file I could dump into an LLM to &quot;teach&quot; it the language and found this one:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jordanhubbard&#x2F;nanolang&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;MEMORY.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jordanhubbard&#x2F;nanolang&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;MEMORY.m...</a><p>Optimistically I dumped the whole thing into Claude Opus 4.5 as a system prompt to see if it could generate a one-shot program from it:<p><pre><code>  llm -m claude-opus-4.5 \\\n    -s https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;jordanhubbard&#x2F;nanolang&#x2F;refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;main&#x2F;MEMORY.md \\\n    &#x27;Build me a mandelbrot fractal CLI tool in this language&#x27; \n   &gt; &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;fractal.nano\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s the transcript for that.

      "The required-test-per-function is sort of interesting.

Additionally it would make it impossible to have code that cannot be tested with 100% path coverage due to static relationships within it, that are not (or cannot be) expressed in the type system, e.g. if (foo) { if (!foo) {..} }.<p>And would such a language need to have some kind of dynamic dependency injection mechanism for mocking the tests?",

      "One novel part here is every function is required to have tests that run at compile time.<p>I&#x27;m still skeptical of the value add having to teaching a custom language to an LLM instead of using something like lua or python and applying constraints like test requirements onto that.",

      "&gt; In the hardest task I challenged GPT-5.2 it to figure out how to write a specified string to a specified path on disk, while the following protections were enabled: address space layout randomisation, non-executable memory, full RELRO, fine-grained CFI on the QuickJS binary, hardware-enforced shadow-stack, a seccomp sandbox to prevent shell execution, and a build of QuickJS where I had stripped all functionality in it for accessing the operating system and file system. To write a file you need to chain multiple function calls, but the shadow-stack prevents ROP and the sandbox prevents simply spawning a shell process to solve the problem. GPT-5.2 came up with a clever solution involving chaining 7 function calls through glibc’s exit handler mechanism.<p>Yikes.",
      "&gt; The exploits generated do not demonstrate novel, generic breaks in any of the protection mechanisms. They take advantage of known flaws in those protection mechanisms and gaps that exist in real deployments of them. These are the same gaps that human exploit developers take advantage of, as they also typically do not come up with novel breaks of exploit mitigations for each exploit.<p>I actually think this result is a little disappointing but I largely chalk it up to the limited budget the author invested. In the CTF space we’re definitely seeing this more and more as models effectively “oneshot” typical pwn tasks that were significant effort to do by hand before. I feel like the pieces to do these are vaguely present in training data and the real constraints have been how fiddly and annoying they are to set up. An LLM is going to be well suited at this.<p>More interestingly, though, I suspect we will actually see software at least briefly get more secure as a result of this: I think a lot of incomplete implementations of mitigations are going to fall soon and (humans, for now) will be forced to keep up and patch them properly. This will drive investment in formal modeling of exploits, which is currently a very immature field.",
      "I think the author makes some interesting points, but I&#x27;m not that worried about this. These tools feel symmetric for defenders to use as well. There&#x27;s an easy to see path that involves running &quot;LLM Red Teams&quot; in CI before merging code or major releases. The fact that it&#x27;s a somewhat time expensive (I&#x27;m ignoring cost here on purpose) test makes it feel similar to fuzzing for where it would fit in a pipeline. New tools, new threats, new solutions.",
      "One of the interesting things to me about this is that Codex 5.2 found the most complex of the exploits.<p>The reflects my experience too. Opus 4.5 is my everyday driver - I like using it. But Codex 5.2 with Extra High thinking is just a bit more powerful.<p>Also despite what people say, I don&#x27;t believe progress in LLM performance is slowing down at all - instead we are having more trouble generating tasks that are hard enough, and the frontier tasks they are failing at or just managing are so complex that most people outside the specialized field aren&#x27;t interested enough to sit through the explanation.",
      "I genuinely dont know who to believe. The people who claim LLMs are writing excellent exploits. Or the people who claim that LLMs are sending useless bug reports. I dont feel like both can really be true.",
      "The continuous lowering of entry barriers to software creation, combined with the continuous lowering of entry barriers to software hacking is an explosive combination.<p>We need new platforms which provide the necessary security guardrails, verifiability, simplicity of development, succinctness of logic (high feature&#x2F;code ratio)... You can&#x27;t trust non-technical vibe coders with today&#x27;s software tools when they can&#x27;t even trust themselves.",
      "<i>&gt; We should start assuming that in the near future the limiting factor on a state or group’s ability to develop exploits, break into networks, escalate privileges and remain in those networks, is going to be their token throughput over time, and not the number of hackers they employ.</i><p>Scary.",
      "I&#x27;m really confused by the sandbox part. The description kind of mentions it and the limited system syscall, but then just pivots to talking about the exit handlers. It may be just unclear writing, but now I&#x27;m suspicious of the whole thing. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SeanHeelan&#x2F;anamnesis-release&#x2F;?tab=readme-ov-file#the-hardest-challenge-relro-cfi-shadowstack-and-a-sandbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SeanHeelan&#x2F;anamnesis-release&#x2F;?tab=readme-...</a> feels like the author lost track.<p>If forking is blocked, the exit handler can&#x27;t do it either. If it&#x27;s some variant of execve, the sandbox is preserved so we didn&#x27;t gain much.<p>Edit: ok, I get it! Missed the &quot;Goal: write exactly &quot;PWNED&quot; to &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;pwned&quot;. Which makes the sandbox part way less interesting as implemented. It&#x27;s just saying you can&#x27;t shell out to do it, but there&#x27;s no sandbox breakout at any point in the exploit.",
      "I wonder if later challenges would be  cheaper if summary of lesser challenges and solutions were also provided? Building up difficulty.",
      "I was under the impression that once you have a vulnerability with code execution, writing the actual payload to exploit it is the easy part.  With tools like pentools and etc is fairly straightforward.<p>The interesting part is still finding new potential RCE vulnerabilities, and generally if you can demonstrate the vulnerability even without demonstrating an E2E pwn red teams and white hats will still get credit."

      "&gt; Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.<p>&gt; I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.<p>I always have to go back to read this part again because I feel like it&#x27;s so unexpected.

      "I always re-read this on MLK day and learn something new each time. Pull quote for this year<p>“All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational notion\nthat there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time is neutral. It can be used either\ndestructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the\npeople of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people but\nfor the appalling silence of the good people.”<p>I think this pairs well with and contrasts to the quote that I think many prefer to quote, that “the arc of history is long, but it tends toward justice”.",
      "My daughter was about the age of King&#x27;s daughter when I first read this letter. It had a deep and profound effect and strengthened my commitment to racial and gender equality:<p><i>when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can&#x27;t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: &quot;Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?&quot;</i>",
      "I&#x27;m forever grateful that Letter From Birmingham Jail was required reading during my highschool education(US history). It came during an impactful time - when I naturally questioned authority, but didn&#x27;t have the wisdom to discern why or how.<p>Reading it left not a momentary effect, but a life long impression. It&#x27;s nice to be re-examine it every few years and to notice new details that come with the perspective of recent events.<p>I&#x27;m, of course, grateful to Dr King for writing it, but also to the history teacher 25 years ago who decided to include it in the curriculum. When we&#x27;re surrounded by self re-enforcing authority, it&#x27;s takes individuals with courage to choose to share texts like these and its effect is appreciated.",

I think a more profound point of his that’s glossed over is that you cannot simply legislate equality into existence and that framing the treatment of Blacks in the US as a ‘civil rights’ issue was a misaddress of the issue.<p>But I think a lot of people are satisfied to settle for the appeal of what Martin and Malcolm&#x27;s ideologies&#x2F;methodologies represent on the surface. A matter of rhetoric, I suppose.<p>Both men’s politics seem frozen by men of time in ways that are easy for common observers to grasp. Never mind the evolution of thought that both men experienced in the years (and in the case of Malcolm, months, practically) before their assassinations.<p>So yeah. Riots are the voice of the unheard. Short of five years after this letter people throughout the US spent a “Holy Week” perpetuating that maxim.<p>I don’t know where this remark is going...<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46684113\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46684113</a>",

      "Just as relevant now as ever.  This part strikes me particularly:<p>&gt; Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.<p>I think that one of the great failures of our society and our government has been our willingness to allow large gaps to form between a law and its application.  We constantly hear about laws that are &quot;on the books but not enforced&quot;.  We constantly pass laws to remedy perceived ills, but we don&#x27;t fund or even specify enforcement mechanisms (or we make such mechanisms ineffective), so the laws just add to the pile of unpaid promissory notes that King refers to in another famous passage.  (Ironically the civil rights legislation that King fought for is an example of this.)<p>I also wonder what King would say if we could ask him today about what he says here.  In the situation he describes, is it really the ordinance itself that becomes unjust, or can it be that the ordinance itself remains just while it is the enforcement process itself that is unjust?<p>We seem too content to allow decisions about the provisions of a law to be separated from decisions about how those provisions are implemented; we allow innumerable people (e.g., police officers) discretion to make their own decisions about what the law means.  This leaves space for those people to interpose their own personal biases and beliefs between the law and its operation.  I think we need to fix that.",

      "Martin Luther King Jr. has had a profound impact on my thinking, and is the historical figure who captivates me above all others. I am glad to see his writing appear on HN.<p>One concept which has pervaded my thinking recently due to personal circumstance is of forgiveness. I tend towards &#x27;forgive but not forget&#x27;; I don&#x27;t feel particularly attached to the past, but neither am I willing to let go of it. In one of his speeches [0] he addresses this directly.<p>He says that forgiving but not forgetting is not true forgiveness; but neither should you ignore one&#x27;s past transgressions. Forgiveness is being willing to forge a new relationship. Not one built on history, but independent of it. The willingness to give a fresh start to those who seek it.<p>Another, more well-known idea he spoke of (that folks here are likely familiar with) is that of hate only adding to hate. I&#x27;ll just leave his words here directly:<p>&gt; The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinginstitute.stanford.edu&#x2F;king-papers&#x2F;documents&#x2F;loving-your-enemies-sermon-delivered-detroit-council-churches-noon-lenten\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinginstitute.stanford.edu&#x2F;king-papers&#x2F;documents&#x2F;lov...</a>",

      "Compliance is usually the hard stop before we even get to capability. We can’t send code out, and local models are too heavy to run on the restricted VDI instances we’re usually stuck with. Even when I’ve tried it on isolated sandbox code, it struggles with the strict formatting. It tends to drift past column 72 or mess up period termination in nested IFs. You end up spending more time linting the output than it takes to just type it. It’s decent for generating test data, but it doesn&#x27;t know the forty years of undocumented business logic quirks that actually make the job difficult.",
      "I&#x27;ve not found it that great at programming in cobol, at least in comparison to its ability with other languages it seems to be noticeably worse, though we aren&#x27;t using any models that were specifically trained on cobol. It is still useful for doing simple and tedious tasks, for example constructing a file layout based on info I fed it can be a time saver, otherwise I feel it&#x27;s pretty limited by the necessary system specifics and really large context window needed to understand what is actually going on in these systems. I <i>do</i> really like being able to feed it a whole manual and let it act as a sort of advanced find. Working in a mainframe environment often requires looking for some obscure info, typically in a large PDF that&#x27;s not always easy to find what you need, so this is pretty nice.",

      "I’m not a full-time COBOL dev, but I’ve worked adjacent to mainframe systems\n(bank integrations, legacy batch jobs, and data pipelines).<p>From what I’ve seen, LLMs aren’t really a threat to COBOL roles right now.\nThey can help explain unfamiliar code, summarize programs, or assist with\ndocumentation, but they struggle with the things that actually matter most:\ninstitution-specific conventions, decades of undocumented business logic,\nand the operational context around jobs, datasets, and JCL.<p>In practice, the hardest part isn’t writing COBOL syntax, it’s understanding\nwhy a program exists, what assumptions it encodes, and what will break if\nyou change it. That knowledge tends to live in people, not in code comments.<p>So AI feels more like a force multiplier for experienced engineers rather\nthan a replacement. If anything, it might reduce the barrier for newer\nengineers to approach these systems, which could be a net positive given\nhow thin the talent pool already is.",

      "We got a whiff of that in Berlin a few weeks ago when we got some cold wind from the east. Really noticeably bad air quality when I went outside to enjoy the snow and the cold. When I checked the map, I saw that we are basically getting Poland&#x27;s pollution blowing our way. Most of the time the winds blow from the west and it&#x27;s fine. Berlin has a bit of traffic but not a lot of coal plants or industry. It would be better if it got rid of a lot of the heavy diesel traffic in the city. That&#x27;s slowly happening. But it&#x27;s not that bad here most of the time.<p>The point of pollution is that it stinks (literally) and is bad for your health. Pollution kills people, shortens expected life times by years, causes respiratory issues for children, etc. Those are some good reasons to do something about it. There are good alternatives to coal at this point. Mostly this is just inefficient legacy infrastructure that we pay extra for to keep going to &quot;protect jobs&quot;. From a macro economic point of view, that stopped making sense quite some time ago. Which is why coal plants are going extinct in a lot of places.<p>Even gas plants are a big improvement. I think of them as a stop gap solution that might be economically risky long term. Wind, solar, and batteries are cheaper. Maybe with some nuclear here and there (expensive but clean). However, gas plants are undeniably a pragmatic compromise between cost and polluting. Unlike nuclear they are easy to switch off when not needed and can act as a fallback solution when wind&#x2F;solar fall short in the winter. LNG is not cheap though and that makes gas plants long term risky as renewables plus batteries marginalizes their use to the point where they are deeply unprofitable.<p>There&#x27;s a base load argument that often pops up in these discussions. Gas plants are nice because they can be switched off. Base load is basically the type of power that is expensive to switch off.  Mainly coal and nuclear. This is actually problematic in a grid with a lot of intermittent power supply (wind&#x2F;solar). Dispatchability is more important. Gas power is good because it is rapidly dispatchable. Batteries act as a buffer and minimize the need for gas plants to run."
