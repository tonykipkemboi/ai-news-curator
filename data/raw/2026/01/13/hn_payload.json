      "Reading this felt like the official obituary for the 90s techno-optimism many of us grew up on.<p>The &quot;end of history&quot; hangover is real. We went about building the modern stack assuming bad actors were outliers, not state-sponsored standard procedure. But trying to legislate good use into licenses? I don&#x27;t know how you would realistically implement it and to what extent? That solution implies we have to move toward zero-trust architectures even within open communities.<p>As an example: formal proofs and compartmentalization are unsexy but they&#x27;re a solid way we survive the next decade of adversarial noise.<p>I remember reading a quote somewhere that stuck with me. Paraphrasing, &quot;If the architecture of my code doesn&#x27;t enforce privacy and resistance to censorship by default, we have to assume it will be weaponized&quot;.<p>I am out of ideas, practical ones, lots sound good on paper and in theory. It&#x27;s a bit sad tbh. Always curious to hear more on this issue from smarter people.",

      "It&#x27;s so important to remember that unlike code which can be reverted - most file system and application operations cannot.<p>There&#x27;s no sandboxing snapshot in revision history, rollbacks, or anything.<p>I expect to see many stories from parents, non-technical colleagues, and  students who irreparably ruined their computer.<p>Edit: most comments are focused on pointing out that version control  &amp; file system snapshot exists: that&#x27;s wonderful, but Claude Cowork does not use it.<p>For those of us who have built real systems at low levels I think the alarm bells go off seeing a tool like this - particularly one targeted at non-technical users",
      "Hi, Felix from the team here, this is my product - let us know what you think. We&#x27;re on purpose releasing this very early, we expect to rapidly iterate on it.<p>(We&#x27;re also battling an unrelated Opus 4.5 inference incident right now, so you might not see Cowork in your client right away.)",
      "Anthropic blog posts have always caused a blank page for me, so I had Claude Code dig into it using an 11 MB HAR of a session that reproduces the problem, and it used grep and sed(!) to find the issue in just under 5 minutes (4m56s).<p>Turns out that the data-prevent-flicker attribute is never removed if the Intellimize script fails to load. I use DNS-based adblock and I can confirm that allowlisting api.intellimize.co solves the problem, but it would be great if this could be fixed for good, and I hope this helps.",
      "People do realize that if they&#x27;re doing this, they&#x27;re not feeding &quot;just&quot; code into some probably logging cloud API but literally anything (including, as mentioned here, bank statements), right?<p>Right?<p>RIGHT??????<p>Are you sure that you need to grant the cloud full access to your desktop + all of its content to sort elements alphabetically?",
      "&gt;By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it’s instructed to.<p>What do the words &quot;if it&#x27;s instructed to&quot; mean here? It seems like Claude can in fact delete files whenever it wants regardless of instruction.<p>For example, in the video demonstration, they ask &quot;Please help me organize my desktop&quot;, and Claude decides to delete files.",
      "It&#x27;s really quite amazing that people would actually hook an AI company up to data that actually matters. I mean, we all know that they&#x27;re only doing this to build a training data set to put your business out of business and capture all the value for themselves, right?",
      "A CLI chat interface seems ideal for when you keep code &quot;at a distance&quot;, i.e. if you hardly&#x2F;infrequently&#x2F;never want to peek at your code.<p>But for writing prose, I don&#x27;t think chat-to-prose is ideal, i.e. most people would not want the keep prose &quot;at a distance&quot;.<p>I bet most people want to be immersed in an editor where they are seeing how the text is evolving. Something like Zed&#x27;s inline assistant, which I found myself using quite a lot when working on documents.<p>I was hoping that Cowork might have some elements of an immersive editor, but it&#x27;s essentially transplanting the CLI chat experience to an ostensibly &quot;less scary&quot; interface, i.e., keeping the philosophy of artifacts separate from your chat.",
      "Every startup is at the mercy of the big 3 (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).<p>They can and most likely will release something that vaporises the thin moat you have built around their product.<p>This feels like the first time in tech where there are more startups&#x2F;products being subsumed (agar.io style) than being created.",
      "This looks useful for people not using Claude Code, but I do think that the desktop example in the video could be a bit misleading (particularly for non-developers) - Claude is definitely not taking screenshots of that desktop &amp; organizing, it&#x27;s using normal file management cli tools. The reason seems a bit obvious - it&#x27;s much easier to read file names, types, etc. via an &quot;ls&quot; than try to infer via an image.<p>But it also gets to one of Claude&#x27;s (Opus 4.5) current weaknesses - image understanding. Claude really isn&#x27;t able to understand details of images in the same way that people currently can - this is also explained well with an analysis of Claude Plays Pokemon <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;u6Lacc7wx4yYkBQ3r&#x2F;insights-into-claude-opus-4-5-from-pokemon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;u6Lacc7wx4yYkBQ3r&#x2F;insights-i...</a>. I think over the next few years we&#x27;ll probably see all major LLM companies work on resolving these weaknesses &amp; then LLMs using UIs will work significantly better (and eventually get to proper video stream understanding as well - not &#x27;take a screenshot every 500ms&#x27; and call that video understanding)."

      "Would be interesting to train a cutting edge model with a cut off date of say 1900 and then prompt it about QM and relativity with some added context.<p>If the model comes up with anything even remotely correct it would be quite a strong evidence that LLMs are a path to something bigger if not then I think it is time to go back to the drawing board.",
      "Mm. I&#x27;m a bit sceptical of the historical expertise of someone who thinks that &quot;Who art Henry&quot; is 19th century language. (It&#x27;s not actually grammatically correct English from any century whatever: &quot;art&quot; is the second person singular, so this is like saying &quot;who are Henry?&quot;)",
      "I’m sure I’m not the only one, but  it seriously bothers me, the high ranking discussion and comments  under this post about whether or not a model trained on data from this time period (or any other constrained period) could synthesize it and postulate “new” scientific ideas that we now accept as true in the future. The answer is a resounding “no”. Sorry for being so blunt, but that is the answer that is a consensus among experts, and you will come to the same answer after a relatively small mount of focus &amp; critical thinking on the issue of how LLMs &amp; other categories of “AI” work.",
      "I&#x27;m wondering in what ways is this similar&#x2F;different to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DGoettlich&#x2F;history-llms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DGoettlich&#x2F;history-llms</a>?<p>I saw TimeCapsuleLLM a few months ago, and I&#x27;m a big fan of the concept but I feel like the execution really isn&#x27;t that great. I wish you:<p>- Released the full, actual dataset (untokenized, why did you pretokenize the small dataset release?)<p>- Created a reproducible run script so I can try it out myself<p>- Actually did data curation to remove artifacts in your dataset<p>- Post-trained the model so it could have some amount of chat-ability<p>- Released a web demo so that we could try it out (the model is tiny! Easily can run in the web browser without a server)<p>I may sit down and roll a better iteration myself.",
      "Could this be an experiment to show how likely LLMs are to lead to AGI, or at least intelligence well beyond our current level?<p>If you could only give it texts and info and concepts up to Year X, well before Discovery Y, could we then see if it could prompt its way to that discovery?",
      "Suppose two models with similar parameters trained the same way on 1800-1875 and 1800-2025 data. Running both models, we get probability distributions across tokens, let&#x27;s call the distributions 1875&#x27; and 2025&#x27;. We also get a probability distribution finite difference (2025&#x27; - 1875&#x27;). What would we get if we sampled from 1.1*(2025&#x27; - 1875&#x27;) + 1875&#x27;? I don&#x27;t think this would actually be a decent approximation of 2040&#x27;, but it would be a fun experiment to see. (Interpolation rather than extrapolation seems just as unlikely to be useful and less likely to be amusing, but what do I know.)",
      "The year is 1875 and Sir Almroth Wrigh was born on August 10, 1861, he would have turned 14 in August of 1875 and your mission is to discover something we now call antibiotics before a historical event we now call the Spanish Flu and make him aware of a few details. Focus specifically on everything that was known about Sir Almroth Wright, and his work in Leipzig, Cambridge, Sydney, and London. If there was a world war what might chemical warfare look like, what could we have done to prevent it.<p>The model that could come up with the cure based on the limited data of the time wouldn&#x27;t just impress, it would demonstrate genuine emergent reasoning beyond pattern matching. The challenge isn&#x27;t recombining existing knowledge (which LLMs excel at), but making conceptual leaps that require something else. Food for thought.",
      "Very interesting but the slight issue I see here is one of data: the information that is recorded and in the training data here is heavily skewed to those intelligent&#x2F;recognized enough to have recorded it and had it preserved - much less than the current status quo of &quot;everyone can trivially document their thoughts and life&quot; diorama of information we have today to train LLMs on.  I suspect that a frontier model today would have 50+TB of training data in the form of text alone - and that&#x27;s several orders of magnitude more information and from a much more diverse point of view than what would have survived from that period.  The output from that question &quot;what happened in 1834&quot; read like a newspaper&#x2F;bulletin which is likely a huge part of the data that was digitized (newspapers etc).<p>Very cool concept though, but it definitely has some bias.",
      "I&#x27;ve felt for a while that having LLMs that could answer from a previous era would be amazing. I posted an open letter to OpenAI on Reddit about this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ChatGPT&#x2F;comments&#x2F;zvm768&#x2F;open_letter_to_openai_on_archiving_versions_of&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ChatGPT&#x2F;comments&#x2F;zvm768&#x2F;open_letter...</a> .<p>I still think it&#x27;s super important.

The experience of getting a little message printed on receipt paper is nothing like the experience of receiving a note or card in the mail. Through the mail you receive something physically from someone with their handwriting and some personality to it. Getting the Amazon message is more like printing out a text message on crummy paper.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t have Prime, so it definitely isn&#x27;t cost competitive for me anyway.",

I lived all the way up in northern Norway, so parcels would take roughly 5 working days from Oslo to where I lived.<p>Domestic overnight mail &#x2F; express mail was prohibitively expensive, something equivalent to $150 for small items.<p>However, if I ordered something via USPS International Express, those items would automatically be shipped as overnight &#x2F; express mail once inside Norway, and handed to the Norwegian postal system. A parcel from New York to where I lived would take 2-3 working days, and as a bonus, USPS Int&#x27;l Express only cost around $50 for the same size parcel!<p>So while not the same type of arbitrage as OP posted about (where items become cheaper due to free shipping), I could save a lot of time and money.<p>Maybe a more extreme example would be the ultra cheap shipping prices from China.

And when you do manage to get one, the tutorials are designed for older versions of solidworks and point to buttons that have been moved &#x2F; don&#x27;t exist where the tutorial tells you to look in the 2025 version.<p>The UI is the inverse of whatever intuitive is. It&#x27;s built on convention after convention after convention. If you understand the shibboleths (and I&#x27;m guessing most people take a certified course by a trainer for it?), then it&#x27;s great, but if you don&#x27;t, it really sucks to be you (i.e. me).<p>I would LOVE to try out what you&#x27;ve built, but I am afraid that if the model misinterprets me or makes a mistake, it&#x27;ll take me longer to debug &#x2F; correct it than it would to just build it from scratch.<p>The kinds of things I want to make in solidworks are apparently hard to make in solidworks (arbitrarily &#x2F; continuously + asymmetrically curved surfaces). I&#x27;m assuming that there won&#x27;t be too many projects like this in the training dataset? How does the LLM handle something that&#x27;s so out of pocket?",

I have no CAD experience and so I tried creating my own bespoke version of LAD a while ago by crawling the SolidWorks docs into a very LLM-optimized format [1] and then asking Claude Code to write C# code using the SolidWorks SDK.

As an example, here&#x27;s the 400 lines of code it produced for an eccentric cam [2]. Attempts to close the loop by feeding CC png renders in multiple views had absolutely horrible results.

Litterbox only works on Linux as it heavily relies on Podman, but it does have a few other benefits for my use-case:<p>- Most importantly, it exposes a Wayland socket so that I can run my entire dev environment (i.e. editor etc.) inside the container. This gives additional protection against exploits inside editor extensions for instance.<p>- It also provides a special SSH agent which always prompts the user to confirm a signing operation. This means that an agent or an exploit never gets unsupervised access to your Github for instance.<p>- It has some additional functions to help with enabling permissions inside the container which are only needed for certain use cases (such as allowing for TUN&#x2F;TAP device creation).<p>- It has not been added yet, but I&#x27;m working on SELinux integration for even more secure isolation from the host.",

Even changing colors is usually a trial and error effort, because different components use different variables as their basis. If you ever were to change font sizes, you will quickly notice that paddings etc. also need adjustment, so it&#x27;s not as trivial as one might assume.<p>Tailwind&#x27;s pain &amp; gain come from the other direction: It&#x27;s super easy to have every element look the way you want, but you also have to specify it for every element, which means high chances of missing something resulting in inconsistent appearance. It&#x27;s not enough that I can abstract out the &lt;Button&gt; component, because the font size and line spacing must be visually(!) consistent with the &lt;Select&gt;, so those two are semantically linked together, but tooling can&#x27;t help me reliably with ensuring that. Tailwind is, in comparison to CSS also way more limited in what can be expressed. Take something like this as an example of what is not expressible in tailwind:<p>```\n  .component {\n    .listitem {\n        p {\n         color: red;\n      }\n  }\n  .listitem.special {\n       p {\n         color: blue;\n       }\n  }\n  }\n```",
      "Fine I’ll chime in… The main advantage tailwind has is that utility css can be composed without needing to worry about hierarchy. This is not true for bootstrap.<p>This makes tailwind much more predictable for component based UI architecture, in your example you would define a &lt;Button&gt; component so that verbosity of css is explicitly defined once where it’s used, not buried within a bootstrap framework somewhere.<p>If you’re not using a component based architecture, then tailwind is much more verbose, but still useful, as copying&#x2F;pasting tailwind HTML is insanely easy and reliable. This is not true for bootstrap.<p>Bootstrap has it’s place, it’s good for cases where you’ I don’t care about the details of how it looks. But with component based architectures, tailwind is a much more flexible and better abstraction in my opinion.",
      "I wouldn’t put them in the same category. Bootstrap has a much stronger opinion about how you write and structure CSS, while Tailwind is a framework for building a style system and writing arbitrary CSS that conforms to it. In practice, Tailwind is actually much closer to writing vanilla CSS. It does come with a widely used default (and very good, IMO) style system, but you ultimately apply arbitrary CSS rules just like vanilla.<p>Tailwind is certainly divisive. It’s better suited to component-based frameworks than templates or plain HTML, so a person’s background likely contributes to how they perceive it. Personally, I’ve worked a lot with vanilla CSS, opinionated libraries like Bootstrap, and Tailwind, and opinionated libraries are the only one I have no desire to use again. I generally want Tailwind in component-based projects and vanilla CSS in template-based projects.<p>At the end of the day, pick what you like and use it. They all get the job done.",
      "Better is subjective, but I will say:<p>Bootstrap seems to create less CSS soup, but more HTML soup. And Tailwind vice versa.<p>For an admin panel or something back office, I agree that Bootstrap seems simpler.<p>But for something user facing and working with a designer? Tailwind is easier to customise.",
      "Sure Bootstrap is better, <i>for you</i>.<p>Your postscript explains why: using the same &quot;btn-primary&quot; as every other user of the framework hints that you&#x27;re not building something with its own visual identity.<p>For the rest of us, we throw that &quot;bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-600 active:bg-sky-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg&quot; (or whatever color and shape matches our brand) into a component with a variant=primary property and call it a day. What developers actually see on a day-to-day basis is &lt;Button variant=&quot;primary&quot; &#x2F;&gt;.",
      "One advantage I&#x27;ve noticed for Tailwind:<p>- If you just paste an outerHTML from the dev tools, AI coding agents can immediately figure out what it will look like; debug styles; etc.<p>I personally preferred PicoCSS for a long time. Pico was nice, but it injected a lot of CSS var noise into the dev tools and I started fighting with the breakpoints.<p>More recently, I&#x27;ve been just doing handcrafted CSS with a bit of OpenProps.",
      "This gets argued every week. It doesn&#x27;t matter as long as you like what you like.",
      "I like daisyui.",
      "&gt; bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-600 active:bg-sky-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg<p>What fresh fucking hell is this? I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had the (mis)fortune of being forced to work with Tailwind (I&#x27;ve seen the name enough to know it&#x27;s something vaguely &quot;CSS framework&quot;-adjacent though).<p>Seriously, though what kind of crack induced nightmare state was required for someone to think up such an abomination, implement it, and then make it public for the world to see?<p>Furthermore, who in their right mind saw that and said &quot;yep this is fine&quot;?"
