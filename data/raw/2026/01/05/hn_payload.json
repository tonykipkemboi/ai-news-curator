Nostr is the only decentralized manner (no, Mastodon&#x2F;fediverse is dependent on domain names, which are getting seized by courts in relation to this -- it is not decentralized at all when it comes down to it) that people can reliably use to have a latest content feed distributed.<p>&quot;Check Wikipedia to evade the court order&quot; just encourages legal action against Wikipedia. Even linking to copyright violations is, under current court precedent, able to bring civil liability upon third parties. It is draconian and our framers would have considered it a clear First Amendment violation, but unfortunately the current jurisprudence says that is the law.",

      "Vaguely related anecdotes:<p>- I got caught in the mountains for a few days due to landslides in Nepal. The only available information was relayed by phone between locals. People had no idea of what was going on and their vacation ended on the day the road reopened. It caused a pile up of cars where the road had slid off a few days prior. In some parts, rocks still fell from the cliffs above. We flagged a passing car and asked them to keep us updated on WhatsApp instead. We could have all stayed put if we had that information before.<p>- During covid I maintained a page with simplified local restrictions and a changelog of new restrictions. The alternative was to follow press conferences and re-read the entire regulation the next day, or keep checking the newspapers. Mine was just a bullet list at a permanent location.<p>- During the invasion of Ukraine, refugees have set up the most impressive ad hoc information network I have ever seen. It was operational in 24 hours and kept improving for weeks. People sorted out routes, transport, border issues, accommodation, translation and supplies over Telegram, Notion and Google Docs.<p>Information propagation is critical during emergencies, and people are really bad at it. Setting up a simple website and two-way communication channels makes a huge difference.",

      "I think many of us in the web space that are old enough were shaped by the &quot;mass outage&quot; that happened on 9&#x2F;11 when pretty much all news websites went down while we were looking for information. Slashdot was fighting valiantly to say up and was one of the few sites one could find information on the events (if you were in a spot without access to a cable TV, you were very much in the dark). The web and the infrastructure are substantially different than they were 25 years ago, but I still get a bit of &quot;what if&quot; in the back of my head (not that I work on anything of that level of significance).",

People just the other side of those trees were unable to get out for about a week.<p>Our best source of information, even after we started to get a bit of service, was an inReach. I messaged a friend far from the region and asked them really specific questions like, &quot;Tell me when I can get from our house to I-26 and then south to South Carolina.&quot;<p>Yes, absolutely, emergency information sites should be as light as possible.

      "As a former contractor and current hirer of contractors, I wish I understood this more when I was on the other side.<p>This story is an outlier (10x!) and probably should have involved more communication, but the ultimate lesson checks out.<p>I used to be so embarrassed to send my invoice or charge more as scope increased. If something went unpaid, I&#x27;d rather eat the cost than reach out with a reminder. Turns out it&#x27;s more likely someone didn&#x27;t think about it or forgot than any sort of malice.<p>As a contractor, you think of money in terms of actual dollars – rent, food, etc. When you&#x27;re paying the invoice, you think of it as a resource used to get either get results or get your own time back.<p>It&#x27;s not that companies don&#x27;t care about money (they do, a lot), but the math is much different on their end. Money can feel like an equalizer (it&#x27;s how we serialize time, resources, etc into a common way to transact), but if you&#x27;re a contractor, you can make way more if you understand the perspective of the person paying you.<p>For example, proactive communication and hitting deadlines is much more important than saving costs.",

I was beating myself for not sending the invoice every week in the process, yet there I was with what I thought was a giant bill.<p>For context, the company that commissioned the work paid over $100k for that single page (I was in the email chain). It was part of a wider campaign that involved a whole lot of work, interviews, filming, celebrity appearances, etc. I just checked and the page is still up!<p>Ps: it involves that reliable car company, news paper, and mothers.",

I decided that was a slippery slope.<p>Had I been working on-site, which consumed all my time without flexibility, then I&#x27;d bill for every hour on-site, and maybe for travel time.<p>But since we were doing remote (this was before Covid), with hours that I set -- and my clients were serious people, working on serious stuff -- I wanted to be serious too.",

In many there are layers of managers whose jobs are little more than to attend meetings with each other and tickle down the bare minimum of requirements to delivery teams. So it&#x27;s no surprise that they can be willingly blind to the inefficiency of the process that guarantees their job.<p>My story of being paid to do nothing involves spending a month waiting for my own PC and login details at a large corp, being billed at $1200+ a day. It was mind-numbing and demotivating and I soon left.<p>Hopefully these experiences made me a better manager when I started hiring contractors. I always had a computer &amp; user account ready, scripted any local environments needed and work lined up, plus never asking them to start first thing in the morning due to my experience of waiting around in a new office whilst waiting for everybody I needed to arrive and have their first coffee.

I did not attempt to access other users’ conversations or prove cross-user compromise&quot; - I put this through burpsuite and the UUID&#x27;s are not tied to a session because you can access the chatbot without logging in.

To play with the result of a prompt, take copious notes, feed them back to the agent, not ship until the thing is polished to a shine. To feature flag the changes, review all code in excruciating detail as though it was written by a dyslexic intern, add all the metrics and logs one can think of (VictoriaMetrics), add user-behavior logging (Amplitude&#x2F;Posthog) and monitor the thing like your livelihood depends on it.

      "I don&#x27;t like typing long messages on my phone so this workflow, as cool as it sounds, wouldn&#x27;t work for me. My current setup is that I have a Claude Code hook that runs whenever CC needs my input and it uses my Home Assistant instance to send a push notification to my phone. I then return back to the computer and continue on the work.<p>This works reasonably well, but there is a gap for small messages or review comments. I am waiting for Anthropic to shop a feature where the Claude mobile app is able to mirror Claude Code (not the Claude desktop app) and lets me see the diffs of the changes it made and send commands.

      "Note: At the point of writing this, the comments are largely skeptical.<p>Reading this as an avid Codex CLI user, some things make sense and reflect lessons learned along the way. However, the patterns also get stale fast as agents improve and may be counterproductive. One such pattern is context anxiety, which probably reflects a particular model more than a general problem, and is likely an issue that will go away over time.<p>There are certainly patterns that need to be learned, and relearned over time. Learning the patterns is sort of an anti-pattern, since it is the model that should be trained to alleviate its shortcomings rather than the human. Then again, a successful mindset over the last three years has been to treat models as another form of intelligence, not as human intelligence, by getting to know them and being mindful of their strengths and weaknesses. This is quite a demanding task in terms of communication, reflection, and perspective-taking, and it is understandable that this knowledge is being documented.<p>But models change over time. The strengths and weaknesses of yesterday’s models are not the same as today’s, and reasoning models have actually removed some capabilities. A simple example is giving a reasoning model with tools the task of inspecting logs. It will most likely grep and parse out smaller sections, and may also refuse an instruction to load the file into context to inspect it. The model then relies on its reasoning (system 2) rather than its intuitive (system 1) thinking.<p>This means that many of these patterns are temporary, and optimizing for them risks locking human behavior to quirks that may disappear or even reverse as models evolve. YMMV.",

      "Cool! Earlier in 2025 I decided I wanted to design a CAN-FD connected motor controller for RRF &#x2F; Klipper &#x2F; custom firmware without any experience.<p>I&#x27;m a software eng now working outside of the tech sphere so not exactly an electronics expert. I know enough to be dangerous but thats about it.<p>I found Gemini to be pretty great at validating an exported KiCAD netlist against the relevant datasheets with a few caveats.<p>The RP2350 datasheet in particular was an issue due to its sheer size - bigger than the maximum token limit.<p>I got around this by extracting the relevant parts of the datasheet myself.<p>It sounds like you might have this well in hand but worth asking anyway. I assume you&#x27;ve had good experiences testing with MCU datasheets and not just passives &#x2F; power components?<p>When it got something wrong it was wrong enough to be noticeable by a non expert and with iterations over the schematic and an incredible amount of time spent learning how to lay stuff out properly, I got a reasonably complex board (double sided, 6 layer, roughly 130 components) produced and fully functional first time.<p>I&#x27;m interested in trying this out on my working design and seeing what it comes up with!<p>If you can keep this cheap enough for hobby use (or pay as you go for example) and also find a way to validate or check for common layout concerns then that would be incredibly powerful.<p>It&#x27;s great to see some genuinely useful use cases for LLM tech that isn&#x27;t just &quot;we replaced our support people with a shitty chat bot&quot; :)",

That example at the start is <i>exactly</i> what was needed and how it was found+fixed. Check the datasheets, check the schematic.<p>Only concern is the datasheet limit. We tend to have bigger designs than that. Also we&#x27;re not using KiCAD but maybe it could export.",

I actually learned this a bit earlier in the heyday of stable diffusion where colossal efforts were being spent on designing techniques for prompting and inpainting img2img and understanding the effects of qualifiers and keywords. Large swathes of the community found ways to subtly manipulate the input to obtain specific characteristics in visuals, and common tricks were passed around to produce mostly consistent results.<p>Then LORAs were conceptualized, designed, and implemented by scientific researchers completely unrelated to the community (brought to fine tune LLMs, adapted to work with diffusion), which almost instantly displaced most of those techniques. If you ever wasted any amount of time learning those methods, your knowledge is actively tainted by outdated tidbits that need to be unlearned. Foundational changes of this nature happened frequently.<p>Many similar stories will go untold, im sure.",
