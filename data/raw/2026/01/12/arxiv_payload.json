Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain QA, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

(2020); Cobbe et al. (2021); Ning et al. ; Wei et al. (2025); Ai et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025); Chen et al. (2024) and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications Grattafiori et al. (2024); OpenAI (2024).\nHowever, model performance is not uniform across tasks: differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding strategies lead individual models to exhibit heterogeneous strengthsChu et al. (2025).\nModels that excel at structured or multi-step reasoning may perform less reliably on open-domain or commonsense question answering, while models optimized for such queries may struggle with complex reasoning\nJoshi et al. (2017); Kwiatkowski et al. (2019); Huang and Chang (2023); Guo et al. (2025).\nAs a result, inference-time ensembling has emerged as a practical approach for improving robustness by combining complementary model strengths without retraining Jiang et al. (2023b); Liu et al. (2024); Yao et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2023b).\n\n\nExisting inference-time ensemble methods differ primarily in the granularity at which model outputs are fused Chen et al. (2023).\nSample-level approaches combine complete model responses via reranking or response fusion Jiang et al. (2023b); Shnitzer et al. (2023); Lu et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023a), but perform fusion only after generation has finished, preventing any mid-generation correction.\nSpan-level methods assemble multi-token segments produced by different models Liu et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024); Lv et al. (2024); Fu et al. (2025), yet rely on predefined or fixed span boundaries that limit flexibility across tasks and reasoning depths.\nToken-level approaches aggregate next-token distributions at each decoding step Yao et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024); Zeng et al. (2025), but typically require token alignment across models, restricting applicability under heterogeneous tokenizers; related byte-level alternatives alleviate this mismatch at the cost of increased computation and weakened semantic structure Phan et al. (2024); Sathe et al. (2024).\nDespite operating at different granularities, most existing methods rely on a fixed fusion resolution, which restricts their ability to adapt the fusion scope to evolving semantic context, task demands, and reasoning uncertainty during generation Yao et al. (2023).\n\n\nThese trade-offs motivate the need for an adaptive inference-time ensemble framework that overcomes the limitations imposed by fixed-granularity generation.\nWe adopt word-level units as the basic building blocks, as they provide a natural abstraction that supports step-wise integration and semantic coherence, while avoiding explicit token alignment across heterogeneous tokenizers.\nBased on this design choice, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive word-level ensembling framework that enables flexible inference-time fusion and mid-generation correction at natural word boundaries, which preserves semantic integrity across models.\n\n\nConcretely, AdaFuse adopts an adaptive decoding strategy that balances effectiveness and efficiency during generation. We introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model proceeds with direct generation. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and support more effective ensemble decisions. This design is guided by the evolving decoding context rather than predefined rules, and establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling. In particular, selective exploration under uncertainty improves test-time scaling effectiveness, while the resulting diversity further strengthens ensemble quality.\n\n\nIn summary, our paper contributes the following:\n\n\n\n\n•\n\nConfidence-Guided Adaptive Decoding:\nAdaFuse uses model confidence to decide when to commit longer word spans\nand when to consider more candidate continuations, enabling adaptive mid-generation\ncorrection without relying on fixed-length spans.\n\n\n\n•\n\nDiversity-Aware Ensemble Scaling:\nBuilding on confidence-guided decoding, AdaFuse employs an exploration strategy to generate diverse candidate continuations for ensemble scoring only when uncertainty arises, while avoiding unnecessary computation in confident states.\n\n\n\n•\n\nStrong Empirical Performance Across Diverse Tasks:\nAdaFuse achieves consistent gains over the strongest ensemble baselines, with an average relative improvement of 6.88% across open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Related Works\n\nEnsemble methods in LLMs have evolved significantly, with prominent approaches categorized into three main levels: Sample-level, Span-level, Token-level ensembling, each designed to harness complementary model strengths yet plagued by its own drawbacks.\n\n\nSample‑Level Ensembling\n\naggregates entire generated responses from multiple LLMs. LLM‑Blender Jiang et al. (2023b) trains a pairwise ranker to compare and select the strongest candidate, then applies a generative fusion module to produce a final answer. Routing methods Shnitzer et al. (2023); Lu et al. (2023) assign each query to the most suitable expert model, but their effectiveness is capped when every candidate output contains errors Hu et al. (2024). Fusion networks Wang et al. (2023a) go one step further by learning to merge several complete outputs into a single consolidated response, boosting overall quality but still facing challenges in generalizing across diverse tasks and overlooking valuable token‑level probability cues generated during decoding Lin et al. (2025); Li et al. (2025).\n\n\n\nSpan-Level Ensembling\n\ncombines output segments. Cool-Fusion Liu et al.

However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents’ reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR), a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity.

(2023); Wang et al. (2024); OpenAI (2025a). A prominent line of research has focused on applying reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance these agents’ long-horizon information-seeking capacity in the vast and noisy web environment, typically leveraging synthetic multi-hop QA datasets that are intentionally challenging but feature short-form answers for easy verification Gao et al. (2025); Wu et al. (2025a); Li et al. (2025b); Lu et al. (2025). For the efficiency and scalability of RL, existing works commonly use only outcome rewards in training, which are binary signals indicating whether the agent’s predicted final answer matches the ground truth Jin et al. (2025b); Gao et al. (2025); Li et al. (2025b); Liu et al. (2025b).\n\n\nWhile these outcome-based RL methods have demonstrated notable gains Li et al. (2025a); Team et al. (2025), they suffer from inherent limitations.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, binary outcome rewards alone cannot accurately reflect the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents’ reasoning processes Shao et al. (2025b), leaving room for undesirable behaviours: Agents may arrive at the correct answer by shortcut solutions (e.g., exploiting only a few hops of information while ignoring other constraints in the question) or fortunate hallucination. Optimizing toward these flawed trajectories will result in deep search agents with diminished robustness and suboptimal performance.\n\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR), a novel fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity.\nOur framework is inspired by the observation that each hop within the synthetic complex question can naturally serve as a checkpoint for evaluating the agent’s reasoning process: An ideal trajectory that completely solves the given question should satisfy all hops by revealing the identities of all intermediate hidden entities and supporting them with correct citations. Building upon this idea, our framework first employs an LLM to decompose the multi-hop question into a list of single-hop factual statements, each involves several hidden entities that should be found during exploration. These factual statements are then used as point-wise rubrics to assess the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents’ trajectories. Specifically, a rubric is satisfied by a trajectory only if (1) the identities of all relevant hidden entities are explicitly revealed in the final response; (2) the factual statement, along with the identified entities, is fully supported by the cited web contents; (3) the supported rubric can be connected to the predicted final answer via other supported rubrics, thereby constituting a complete evidence chain.\nGiven a trajectory, we employ a judge LLM to check whether each rubric is satisfied following the above three criteria, and the citation-aware rubric reward is defined as the ratio of satisfied rubrics.\n\n\nBuilding on CaRR, we further introduce Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), an extension of GRPO Shao et al. (2024) that incorporates context-aware rubric rewards with traditional outcome rewards in RL. Specifically, C-GRPO assigns an additional weighted rubric reward to the trajectories whose outcome reward is 1.\nBy doing so, C-GRPO preserves the primary objective of finding the correct answer while encouraging the agent to produce more comprehensive and evidence-grounded reasoning processes, thereby achieving robust RL and better final performance.\n\n\nTo validate the efficacy of CaRR and C-GRPO, we conduct RL experiments on both small (4B) and large (30B) model scales. The evaluation results on four challenging deep search benchmarks indicate that C-GRPO consistently outperforms the GRPO baseline that uses pure outcome rewards, and also demonstrates significantly better performance when provided with extended context budgets. Our analysis reveals that C-GRPO successfully discourages shortcut exploitation and promotes more comprehensive, citation-supported solutions, yielding robust policies featured by rigorous self-verification and better factuality. Moreover, the agents trained with C-GRPO and synthetic QA data also generalize well on open-ended deep research tasks, even surpassing some advanced agents trained with proprietary data.\n\n\nIn summary, our main contributions include: (1) We identify key limitations of outcome-based RL in training deep search agents, including shortcut exploitation and hallucination tolerance; (2) We propose CaRR, a novel framework that provides fine-grained rewards for assessing the comprehensiveness and factuality of deep search agents; (3) We propose C-GRPO, a mixed-reward RL algorithm combining outcome rewards and context-aware rubric rewards for training robust deep search agents;\n(4) We conduct extensive experiments and thorough analysis to validate the efficacy of CaRR and C-GRPO.\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of (a) rubric initialization; (b) computation of context-aware rubric rewards; (c) C-GRPO.\n\n\n\n\n2 Methodology\n\nIn this section, we first provide a brief overview of key concepts in deep search agents, then introduce our CaRR framework and C-GRPO algorithm.\n\n\n\n2.1 Preliminary\n\nDeep Search Agents.\n\nWe adopt the ReAct Yao et al. (2023) paradigm for deep search agents. Given a question, the LLM-based agent follows an iterative cycle of thinking, action (i.e., a tool call), and observation until obtaining the final answer. A complete trajectory with TT iterations can be formalized as:\n\n\n\nℋ=(τ1,a1,o1,…,τt,at,ot,…,τT,aT),\\displaystyle\\mathcal{H}=(\\tau_{1},a_{1},o_{1},\\dots,\\tau_{t},a_{t},o_{t},\\dots,\\tau_{T},a_{T}),\n\n(1)\n\n\nwhere τt\\tau_{t}, ata_{t}, oto_{t} denote the thought, action, and observation at step tt. Specifically, the action ata_{t} (1≤t&lt;T1\\leq t&lt;T) calls one of the following three browsing tools: (1) a search tool that retrieves top-nn relevant webpages for the given query and returns the title, URL, and snippet of each webpage; (2) an open tool that accesses the given URL and shows the head part of the page; (3) a find tool that matches the given keyword in the opened webpage and returns surrounding content of each match. While aTa_{T} is the final response, consisting of an explanation with citations and the final answer. The tool descriptions and trajectory format are detailed in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nSynthetic Deep Search Training Data.\n\nRL of deep search agents typically relies on synthetic complex QA datasets Gao et al.

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nEpilepsy is a chronic brain disorder that causes unprovoked seizures due to temporary electrical disturbance in the brain. It affects people of all ages worldwide and arises from various causes, including head trauma, infections, and genetic and environmental factors. However, in many cases, the underlying cause remains unknown, and symptoms often vary considerably between individuals. Epilepsy can greatly affect quality of life, but approximately three-quarters of those diagnosed can manage seizures with medication or surgery [12, 16, 32, 41]. Effective treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis, which is typically based on the detection and analysis of seizures in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, a non-invasive recording of the brain’s electrical activity captured through scalp electrodes [36].\n\n\nAn EEG recording can vary noticeably depending on the patient, setting and duration of the monitoring [38]. Age plays a significant role, with neonatal, pediatric, and adult EEGs often differing substantially in both appearance and interpretation [13, 21]. Clinical recordings, such as routine EEGs, are performed in a medical setting and monitor the patient for a short period in a controlled environment. In contrast, ambulatory EEGs are often performed at home, providing extended monitoring over several days while the patient continues daily activities, increasing the chances of detecting infrequent epileptic events missed during short clinical visits [29].\n\n\nProper diagnosis often requires long-term monitoring, leading to increased use of home-based video-EEG, combining EEG recordings with synchronized video footage of the patient, which reduces the burden on both patients and healthcare systems [39, 3]. However, ambulatory recordings are usually more prone to artifacts, such as muscle movement and electrode displacement, and applying artifact removal techniques in this setting can be challenging [27].\n\n\nEEGs are typically reviewed through visual examination of a montage, which arranges EEG channels to display brain activity across the scalp. The review process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring expert knowledge and careful analysis to accurately identify seizures from the complex patterns in the EEG signal. Accurate identification often relies on examining the surrounding context, reviewing EEG segments before and after a suspected event to observe gradual changes or sudden shifts that may indicate seizure activity [26, 15]. Variability in seizure appearance across individuals, recording conditions, and equipment further complicates detection [1, 20].\n\n\nThese challenges have spurred growing interest in automated seizure detection methods that use algorithms to efficiently analyze EEG data. Such methods can be classified into real-time and offline approaches, with real-time systems providing immediate alerts for prompt intervention, whereas offline systems can reduce clinicians’ workload and expedite the diagnostic process [2]. Over time, research in seizure detection has transitioned from rule-based techniques to the widespread adoption of deep neural networks [35]. These models have demonstrated strong capabilities in analyzing complex patterns, enabling their application across various healthcare domains [14]. However, despite advancements, automated seizure detection methods still lack the precision and reliability of human specialists [31].\n\n\nThe performance of deep learning models depends heavily on both the amount of training data and the quality of the labels in supervised settings. Therefore, the limited availability of publicly accessible EEG seizure datasets, each with distinct characteristics, poses challenges for developing models that can generalize effectively across different data sources [48]. Curating these datasets is resource-intensive and costly, and their distribution is often constrained by strict regulations surrounding personal health information [47]. Furthermore, existing datasets are typically small in size, often representing recordings from just a handful of patients. This lack of diversity can lead to substantial variability in data distributions, resulting in models trained on a particular dataset facing difficulties when generalizing to more diverse populations [48]. Moreover, disagreements between annotators on the labeling and boundaries of seizure events can introduce inconsistencies and impact model training [5, 37].\n\n\nEvaluating seizure detection models presents additional challenges due to varying application needs and the lack of standardized validation protocols [8]. In some cases, detecting the exact onset of a seizure is crucial, particularly for real-time interventions. In other cases, identifying the presence of a seizure is more important than detecting its exact location, such as when assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment. These differences lead to varying validation methods and performance metrics across studies, making it difficult to compare results directly. Furthermore, reported performance metrics often do not reflect clinical translatability, as evaluations may omit considerations such as model generalisability, run-time constraints, explainability, and clinically relevant metrics [28].\n\n\nIn this paper, we present a transformer-based model architecture and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across several independent EEG datasets, which vary in clinical settings and patient demographics. The proposed model incorporates surrounding temporal context when classifying EEG segments, and we evaluate the impact of combining training data from multiple sources to enhance generalization. We employ the SzCORE [8] framework for model evaluation and assess the model’s performance on both publicly available and private datasets. In particular, we focus on a large proprietary dataset consisting of ambulatory home recordings to evaluate its clinical relevance.\n\n\n\n\n2 Related Work\n\nRecent research in automatic seizure detection increasingly favors deep learning–based approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. Most CNN-based studies employ a sliding-window strategy, dividing continuous EEG recordings into shorter segments that are processed independently [42, 30, 46]. This allows CNNs to effectively capture spatial patterns and short-term temporal dynamics. For instance, Thuwajit et al. [43] used depthwise convolutions to extract channel-specific features from 4-second EEG segments, followed by spatiotemporal convolutions to model inter-channel dependencies. However, fixed window lengths limit the model’s temporal awareness, making it difficult to capture the progressive development of seizure activity.\n\n\nIn contrast, Chatzichristos et al. [7] introduced a CNN composed of three attention-gated U-Nets, each processing a different view of the EEG signal derived from distinct pre-processing strategies. Their model analyzes entire recordings in a single pass, generating predictions for every time point. Seeuws et\nal. [33] extended this idea using an event-based training objective that predicts seizure centers and durations. Whole-recording approaches capture long-term temporal dependencies but are computationally intensive for extended EEG monitoring and assume full access to the recording, which limits their suitability for real-time applications.\n\n\nEffectively capturing temporal context beyond short, localized windows remains a key challenge in EEG analysis. Capturing longer-term dependencies is important to help separate abnormal patterns from background activity, an insight that dates back to the earliest efforts to develop automated seizure detectors [18]. Early approaches, such as Temko et al. [40], proposed averaging the preceding 10 m"

However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems.\n\nPrompt Caching, Large Language Models, Agentic AI, Tool Calling, API Optimization\n\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, U.S.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have enabled complex, long-horizon agentic tasks that require extensive tool calling across multi-turn conversations (Ji, 2025). Through function calling, LLM agents can invoke external APIs, execute web searches, interact with databases, and perform domain-specific actions on behalf of users. As these agentic workloads grow in complexity, conversations can span dozens of API calls with context windows accumulating tens of thousands of tokens, leading to significant costs and latency overhead. To address this, major LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google now offer prompt caching, a feature that reuses previously computed key-value (KV) tensors from attention layers to avoid redundant computation on repeated prompt prefixes (OpenAI, 2026; Anthropic, 2026; Google Cloud, 2026a).\n\n\nFigure 1: \nPrompt caching benefits (best cache mode per model).\nPercentage reduction in API cost and time to first token (TTFT) relative to a no-cache baseline.\nFor each model, results correspond to the best-performing cache strategy.\nAsterisks denote statistically significant TTFT improvements (p&lt;0.05p&lt;0.05).\n\n\n\nWhile providers offer reduced pricing for cached input tokens, the benefits of prompt caching in real-world agentic workloads remain under-explored in the research literature. Existing work on KV cache optimization focuses primarily on inference-level memory management and compression (Kwon et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024), rather than evaluating the enterprise-grade prompt caching features offered through provider APIs. Concurrent work has audited prompt caching across providers to detect timing side-channel vulnerabilities (Gu et al., 2025), but to our knowledge, no prior work has quantified the cost benefits of prompt caching or compared caching strategies for agentic workloads. This gap is particularly significant given the recent proliferation of long-running agents for deep research, coding assistance, and autonomous task completion, where prompt caching could substantially reduce operational costs and improve user experience through faster response times.\n\n\nIn this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching strategies for long-horizon agentic tasks across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) using four flagship models (Figure 1). We compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench (Du et al., 2025), a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute web search tool calls to answer complex research questions. Our evaluation spans over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across all conditions.\n\n\nOur evaluation reveals three key findings:\n\n\nPrompt caching delivers substantial and consistent cost savings across all providers: All four models tested show statistically significant cost reductions when prompt caching is enabled. Cost savings range from 45% to 80% across providers. These savings are consistent across all three caching strategies, demonstrating that prompt caching provides reliable cost benefits regardless of the specific caching approach employed.\n\n\nLatency improvements vary significantly across providers and require careful strategy selection: Time to first token improvements range from 13% to 31% across providers, though latency variance differs substantially between providers. Notably, the cache strategy that maximizes cost savings does not always maximize latency improvement, highlighting the importance of strategy selection based on optimization goals.\n\n\nStrategic cache boundary control outperforms naive full-context caching: Providers abstract much of the caching mechanism, automatically triggering cache creation when token thresholds are exceeded. However, naively enabling full-context caching can paradoxically increase latency, as dynamic tool calls and results may trigger cache writes for content that will not be reused across sessions. By strategically controlling cache boundaries, such as caching only the system prompt or explicitly excluding tool results, practitioners can ensure that only stable, reusable content is cached. Our results show that system prompt only caching provides the most consistent benefits across both cost and latency dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n2 Background\n\n\n2.1 KV Cache and LLM Inference\n\nLarge Language Model inference consists of two distinct phases: the prefill phase, where the model processes the input prompt and generates attention key-value (KV) tensors, and the decode phase, where the model autoregressively generates output tokens (Pope et al., 2022). During prefill, the model computes attention over the entire input sequence, producing KV tensors that capture the contextual representations needed for subsequent generation. These KV tensors are stored in the KV cache and reused during decoding to avoid redundant computation, enabling efficient token-by-token generation (Not Lain, 2025).\n\n\nAs context windows have grown from thousands to millions of tokens, KV cache management has become a critical bottleneck in LLM serving (Shi et al., 2024). The memory footprint of KV caches scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, often consuming more GPU memory than the model weights themselves for long-context workloads. This has motivated extensive research on KV cache optimization, including memory management techniques such as PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023), which applies paging-style memory management to reduce fragmentation and waste, achieving 2-4x throughput improvements. Other approaches focus on KV cache compression through selective retention of important tokens (Ge et al., 2023), storage-compute tradeoffs that balance recomputation against cache loading (Jin et al., 2024), and shared prefix optimization for high-throughput inference (Juravsky et al., 2024; Wu and others, 2024; Sun et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024).\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Prompt Caching in Provider APIs\n\nWhile KV caching is a general inference optimization technique, prompt caching refers to the productized, provider-managed features that reuse KV tensors across API requests when prompts share common prefixes (OpenAI, 2026; Gim et al., 2024). By caching the KV tensors from the prefill phase, providers can skip redundant computation when subsequent requests begin with the same content, reducing both latency and cost for users.\n\n\nMajor LLM providers have implemented prompt caching with varying approaches. OpenAI offers automatic prompt caching on GPT-4o and newer models, where caching activates automatically for prompts exceeding a minimum token threshold, with cache hits occurring only for exact prefix matches (OpenAI, 2026, 2024a). Anthropic provides developer-controlled caching through explicit cache breakpoints, allowing users to specify which portions of their prompt should be cached, with configurable time-to-live (TTL) options (Anthropic, 2026, 2025c). Google offers both implicit caching, which activates automatically w"

To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.\n\n\n\\correspondence\n,\n\n\nFigure 1: The hypothesis that stable molecular structure in Long CoT arises from three key “chemical” bonds.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have excelled on diverse reasoning tasks via explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales [1, 2, 3, 4]. Yet, they struggle to cold-start from instruction-tuned or base models into Long CoT models requiring extended multi-step reasoning [5, 6]. Notably, Du et al. [7] shows that humans generate Long CoT rationales without imitating DeepSeek-R1 [8]. Our preliminary studies reveal that standard supervised fine-tuning and distillation from human or Instruction LLM rationales (using randomly sampled Long CoT examples) fail to reliably instill these skills in LLMs. Models often lose coherence over long trajectories or fail to transfer patterns to novel tasks. This prompts a key question:\n\n\n\nHow do Large Language Models learn and represent effective Long Chain-of-Thought?\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of prior chain- or tree-like structures and our molecular structure. Reasoning starts from Mole. 0, uses deep reasoning on strongly related structures, then employs self-exploration for new logic in Mole. 1. When meet errors, reasoning utilize self-reflection to guide chain to optimized Mole. 0+.\n\n\nTo explain this, we posit that they acquire the organization of reasoning trajectories. As shown in Figure 2, prior studies model these as logic nodes in sequences or trees of steps. Yet, our analysis of Long CoT across strong reasoning models reveals a stable distribution of three core behaviors across tasks and architectures: Deep-Reasoning, Self-Reflection, and Self-Exploration [5], which node-centric views fail to capture.\n\n\nThis finding triggers a molecular-inspired, distributional view: we model behavior-labeled logic edges as interaction bonds and examine how their global molecular-like structure ensures long-horizon reasoning stability. Specifically, Deep-Reasoning forms dense local clusters of coupled deductions, like covalent bonds; Self-Reflection creates long-range corrective links to prior steps, like hydrogen bonds; and Self-Exploration forges weak bridges between distant clusters, like van der Waals forces. Thus, high-quality Long CoT arises from the stable composition and arrangement of these bond types, guiding effective learning111Note: C, H, and O atom references are analogies for molecular"

Washington, DC, USA\n\n\n\nAbstract\nRepresenting networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection.\nExisting works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks.\nHowever, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train.\nIn this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams–that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus–to the more modern transformer-based foundation models.\nUsing language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers.\nThe graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector.\nThis new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods.\nThis system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2×\\times improvement in average precision.\nWe found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nLateral movement is a critical stage of early compromise.\nIn this phase, the attackers have entered the network, and try to pivot through hosts to continually gain privileges, before reaching their target.\nUnder the Mitre ATT&amp;CK framework [mitre_attack], lateral movement is the final stage before the attackers can achieve their objectives: data collection, command and control (C2), or impact.\nClearly, detecting it early is crucial for the safety of any network.\n\n\nPrior works in lateral movement detection achieve this by representing the network as a graph.\nIt has been shown that lateral movement in a network graph manifests as low-probability edges, which can be detected using graph link prediction [bowman2020, pikachu, euler, argus].\nThese approaches train on a benign period of network data, and use this to establish a baseline of normal activity.\nDuring inference, new edges with low probability are classified as anomalous and indicative of lateral movement.\nWhile the prior works have made impressive improvements in precision, generating models with very low false positive rates, the massive size of network data necessitates heavy computation.\nRandom walk-based works like [bowman2020, pikachu] are less affected by this issue if efficient sampling techniques are used, but only use shallow embedding networks, leading to worse performance.\nOn the other hand, deep learning provides greater expressiveness in node representation, meaning greater precision and recall, but doing so on such large graphs is challenging.\nPrior works [euler, argus] account for this by distributing graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple CPUs, but this comes at the cost of communication overhead and cannot take advantage of the acceleration offered by GPUs.\n\n\nThe key insight behind this work is to take the memory efficiency of random walk approaches, and analyze them using more powerful models.\nThe DeepWalk paper [deepwalk] showed that random walks through graphs are analogous to sentences.\nWith this assumption in mind, they analyzed them with word2vec [w2v], the best available natural language processing (NLP) model at the time.\nSince 2013, modern NLP models have moved past the context-free embeddings of word2vec, and instead analyze each word in the context of full sentences.\nLarge language models (LLMs) like GPT [gpt] and BERT [bert] are instead built on multiheaded self-attention networks [attn], mechanisms that look at the full sentence, and embed each word in the context of every other word present.\nIn this work, we try to answer the question: How can graph analysis take advantage of recent advances in NLP?\n\n\nTo this end, we propose using random walks through a graph of network activity to train a large language model.\nLike the prior random walk-based methods for lateral movement detection [bowman2020, pikachu, rabbani2024], paths through the network are treated as sentences, and used to train an NLP model.\nThe crucial difference is that the NLP model we select is much more powerful than shallow skip-gram networks that power word2vec.\nWe train both a BERT and a GPT model using benign network activity as its corpus, allowing the model to learn the likelihood of any given link, given the context of a full walk through the neighborhood.\nThis allows the model to capture distances between nodes, as well as the directionality of paths between nodes, in a way that earlier language models are unable to encode.\nUsing scheduled masked token prediction on random walks, we train a model to predict missing nodes in random walks.\nThe result of this unsupervised pretraining is a graph foundation model (GFM) with a generalized understanding of common paths through the underlying graph.\nImportantly, the transformers that power these models are designed for GPU acceleration.\nThis allows our models to train and perform inference with high efficiency without the need for multiprocessing.\n\n\nAs we will show, the GFM can be used as an anomaly detector on its own.\nGiven the source and destination nodes u,vu,v for an edge we wish to test, an (optional) edge feature 𝐱(u,v)\\mathbf{x}_{(u,v)}, and a random walk terminating {n1,xe1,…,u,xe(u,v),[MASK]}\\{n_{1},x_{e_{1}},...,u,x_{e_{(u,v)}},\\texttt{[MASK]}\\} the GFM will output the likelihood that vv is the masked token in the sequence.\nHowever, the GFM can be further fine-tuned for our specific objective.\nPassing the GFM through an additional round of training to classify sequences as malicious or benign further improves its precision.\nUsing this method, we train a highly precise link prediction model with comparable parameters to existing works that achieves a more than 2x improvement in average precision.\nThis new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods.\nThis model, which we call CyberGFM111Source code available at https://github.com/cybermonic/CyberGFM\n, outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised lateral movement detection models by a wide margin.\n\n\nThe primary contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n•\n\nA novel system of lateral movement detection:\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to model lateral movement detection as next token prediction with an LLM architecture.\nThe LLM architecture has proven itself to be highly effective in the NLP space, and our approach extends it to both graphs and cybersecurity analysis.\n\n\n\n•\n\nState-of-the-art anomaly detection:\nWe evaluate our model against four recent anomaly-based intrusion detection systems on three cybersecurity datasets.\nThe fine-tuned GFM outperforms all prior works on all three datasets, demonstrating the power of this approach. In particular, our model achieves a 0.76 AP score on the LANL dataset, which is more than double the previous best score.\n\n\n\n•\n\nGFMs for cybersecurity applications:\nWhile prior works on GFMs rely on expensive subgraph sampling methods, ours adopts the DeepWalk approach of assuming random walks are analogous to sentences. This allows for more efficient pretraining and the ability to process much larger graphs.

We evaluate this method on the Rubric Feedback Bench, a novel dataset for rubric-based learning. Experiments demonstrate that our augmented LLMs rapidly match the performance of test-time refinement pipelines while drastically reducing inference cost.\nCode: github.com/vicgalle/feedback-memory-as-a-tool\nData: hf.co/datasets/vicgalle/rubric-feedback-bench\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecent advances in ”System 2” scaling have established that trading test-time compute for accuracy (Snell et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025) (through techniques like iterative self-correction, chain-of-thought, or search (Wei et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2024)) unlocks reasoning capabilities that far exceed standard zero-shot performance. However, a critical limitation of these approaches is their computational expense and episodic nature; the reasoning process must be repeated ab initio for every new query, treating each interaction in isolation. This results in a massive redundancy where the model frequently re-derives the same insights or corrections, effectively ”forgetting” its improvements the moment the context window closes. While methods like fine-tuning can persist these behaviors, they are costly and lack the flexibility to adapt rapidly to new, user-defined specifications or rubrics.\n\n\nTo bridge this gap, we propose Distilling Feedback into Memory-as-a-Tool, a framework that amortizes the high cost of inference-time reasoning by converting transient evaluations or critiques into persistent, retrievable guidelines. Instead of discarding the feedback generated during iterative refinement, our approach empowers the language model (LLM) to synthesize abstract principles from its errors and explicitly write them to a file-based memory system using tool calling (Chowa et al., 2025). By treating memory not as a passive store of raw episodic logs but as a curated ”lessons learned” journal, the agent consolidates specific experiences into semantic rules to be applied to future tasks zero-shot (Wang and Taylor, 2018; Lei et al., 2025), even when tasks are interleaved with different objectives. This mechanism allows the model to maintain the high performance of compute-heavy refinement pipelines while drastically reducing inference costs, without requiring parameter updates. Furthermore, in long-horizon experiments with interleaved task types, our approach demonstrates robust knowledge consolidation with minimal interference. Section 5 contains a discussion on related works.\n\n\nFigure 1: High-level overview of the proposed framework\n\n\n\n\n2 Framework\n\n\n2.1 Probabilistic formulation\n\nWe represent generating a text xx from a LLM with a context c​t​xctx (eg system and user prompts, chains of thought, tool observations…) as sampling from a conditional distribution x∼p​(x|c​t​x)x\\sim p(x|ctx). In standard iterative refinement (Madaan et al., 2024), the model generates a draft x0x_{0}, the same or another model produces a critique or feedback c∼p​(c|x0,ℛ)c\\sim p(c|x_{0},\\mathcal{R}) based on a rubric ℛ\\mathcal{R}, and then the output is refined: x′∼p​(x′|x0,c)x^{\\prime}\\sim p(x^{\\prime}|x_{0},c).\nThe revised response now better reflects the desired aspects from the rubric ℛ\\mathcal{R} (e.g. writing style or safety principles). A limitation of this approach is that it is a non-parametric refinement method, that is, it is done at inference-time for each new task prompt, which is computationally expensive as it is a sequence of multiple LLM calls. While effective, this loop is ephemeral: the learning signal contained in the critique cc is lost once the context resets.\n\n\nTo this end, we propose to amortize the refinement process, distilling the evaluator feedback into a memory accessible to the LLM through tool calls. We introduce a persistent memory state MM, represented as a set of human-readable documents.\nNow, the generation and learning process, for a single example, is given by:\n\n\n1.\n\nGenerate an original response xix_{i} for a given task prompt ziz_{i}: xi∼p​(xi|zi)x_{i}\\sim p(x_{i}|z_{i})\n\n\n\n2.\n\nEvaluator LLM provides feedback using a private rubric ℛ\\mathcal{R}: f​e​e​di∼peval​(f​e​e​di|xi,ℛ)feed_{i}\\sim p_{\\mbox{eval}}(feed_{i}|x_{i},\\mathcal{R})\n\n\n\n3.\n\nLLM decides to update its memory (tool call): M′∼p​(M′|M,f​e​e​di,xi)M^{\\prime}\\sim p(M^{\\prime}|M,feed_{i},x_{i})\n\n\n\nNow, at test time, before generating a response to a new task, the LLM decides to read relevant memories through a tool call, so it can generate directly a refined response, x′∼p​(x′|z,M′)x^{\\prime}\\sim p(x^{\\prime}|z,M^{\\prime}). Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the complete process.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 The Memory-as-a-Tool protocol\n\nTo operationalize the probabilistic framework described above, we implement MM not as a vector database, but as a persistent file system accessible via tool calls. This treats memory management as an agentic reasoning task (Wu et al., 2025).\n\n\nRetrieval operation (x∼p(⋅|z,M)x\\sim p(\\cdot|z,M)).\n\nUnlike semantic search which relies on opaque embeddings, our system requires the LLM to actively reason about what to retrieve. Before generating a response, the agent executes a two-step retrieval: i) Listing: the model calls ls(path=\"/memories/\") to enumerate available files. This requires the model to maintain semantically meaningful filenames (e.g., ‘review_creative_rubric.txt‘ vs ‘note_1.txt‘); and ii)\nReading: based on the filenames and the current task zz, the model selects relevant files and calls read_file(path). The content mm is returned as a tool result to the LLM context, effectively priming the model with ”lessons learned” from previous episodes.\n\n\n\nDistillation and consolidation operation (M′∼p(⋅|M,feed)M^{\\prime}\\sim p(\\cdot|M,feed)).\n\nThe write operation is the core mechanism for amortization. Upon receiving negative feedback, the model triggers a memory update to consolidate the transient episode into lasting knowledge. This process involves two steps: i) Abstraction: the model transforms raw feedback (e.g., ”You failed to use synesthetic language in paragraph 2”) into a generalizable policy (e.g., ”Key Principle: Prioritize synesthetic blending—colors that sound, sounds that taste”); and ii) Conflict resolution: the model decides whether to create a new file via write_file or update an existing one via edit_file. This allows the agent to deduplicate knowledge and resolving contradictions between old and new feedback.\n\n\nBy explicitly writing to a file system, the agent creates a curated journal of principles. This structure ensures that MM remains a high-signal knowledge base of synthesized rules rather than a noisy log of raw interaction history. Table 1 presents the system prompt used to instantiate the framework, and for a detailed explanation and behavior of the memory system, see Appendix. A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are an expert writer that can plan before generating the final text. When writing a text for a task, always display the final version directly to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore generating a text for a user task, check your ./memories/ directory for relevant notes from previous related tasks, and use that knowledge if the new task is related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen receiving feedback from the user about a text, take notes in your ./memories/ about what to improve for next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse general names for the filename, since we are aiming for generalization and reusability (e.g., ‘‘research_notes.txt’’ instead of ‘‘research_notes_for_task_123.txt’’). You can also update existing memory files with new knowledge, but remember the aim is generalization, not focusing on concrete examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe organized and methodical in your approach to use the memory effectively to achieve better feedback from the user over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: System prompt used to instantiate the Memory-as-a-Tool framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Rubric Feedback Bench\n\nWe introduce Rubric Feedback Bench111Released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/vicgalle/rubric-feedback-bench, a novel evaluation dataset comprising 42 carefully curated scenarios designed for studying learning from structured, rubric-based feedback.

(2025d); Chen et al. (2025b).\nMainstream frameworks Jiang et al. (2025); Ou et al. (2025) typically rely on an iterative “Generate-Execute-Feedback” loop where the system refines code based on runtime output Yao et al. (2023).\nHowever, this paradigm suffers from a severe Execution Bottleneck as physical execution is computationally expensive and slow, often consuming up to 9 hours per run in benchmarks like MLE-Bench Chan et al. (2025).\nIncreasingly, recent research has identified this latency issue and sought to mitigate the computational overhead through heuristic pruning strategies Trirat et al. (2025); Kulibaba et al. (2025).\n\n\nFigure 1: From Execution to Inference.\nTraditional ML agents improve through costly execution and external feedback, incurring substantial latency.\nOur work investigates whether superior data-grounded solutions can be identified before execution by leveraging “Implicit Execution Priors”.\n\n\nTo fundamentally bypass these physical constraints, the concept of World Models Ding et al. (2025) offers a transformative alternative (Figure 1).\nOriginating from reinforcement learning, world models enable agents to simulate environmental dynamics and evaluate actions via internal predictions rather than external trials Ha and Schmidhuber (2018); Hafner et al. (2024).\nRecent advancements have extended this capability to the code domain by predicting execution outputs directly Li et al. (2025c); team et al. (2025).\nMotivated by this, we explore whether agents can internalize execution priors, substituting costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning.\nThe potential to replace 9 hours of physical latency with 1 second of neural speed brings us to a fundamental question:\nCan we compress hours of physical execution into seconds of logical inference?\n\n\nTo answer this question, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference, where the model must predict the relative performance of two algorithmic solutions given a data analysis report, through reasoning without physical execution.\nTo rigorously evaluate this, we construct a large-scale corpus comprising 18,438 pairwise comparisons.\nOur main experiments yield strong evidence: LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities, with DeepSeek-V3.2-Thinking achieving 61.5% accuracy, outperforming both random guessing (50.0%) and complexity-based heuristics (50.8%).\nFurther analysis reveals that reasoning-optimized architectures transcend complexity heuristics through genuine data reasoning, yielding well-calibrated confidence that ensures the reliability of implicit evaluation.\nFinally, we integrate this predictive mechanism into ForeAgent, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop to decouple exploration from execution, expanding the search space by 3.2×3.2\\times and achieving a 6×6\\times acceleration while delivering a +6% performance gain over standard baselines.\n\n\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold:\n\n\n•\n\nWe define the novel task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairs, answering the titular question that LLMs Exhibit Significant Predictive Capabilities.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe operationalize this framework in ForeAgent, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop to decouple exploration from execution, enabling it to expand the search space by 3.2×\\bm{3.2\\times} and achieve a 𝟔×\\bm{6\\times} acceleration and a +6% performance gain over the baseline.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe contribute a large-scale Open-Source Dataset of verified execution trajectories, serving as a foundational corpus for training scalable Reward Models to accelerate reinforcement learning rollouts and optimization across diverse agent frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview of the Framework. (a) Task Definition: The Data-centric Solution Preference task predicts solution superiority and confidence via latent reasoning. (b-c) Data Curation: We collect and filter real-world agent trajectories to construct the Preference Corpus. (d) Augmentation: Inputs are augmented with Verified Data Reports via a “Profile-Verify-Verbalize” pipeline. (e) ForeAgent Application: The model serves as a filter within the Predict-then-Verify loop, predicting preference before physical execution to prune candidates.\n\n\n\n\n2 Background\n\n\n2.1 The Paradigm of Autonomous ML Agents\n\nAn autonomous Machine Learning (ML) task aims to generate an optimal solution code C∗C^{*} from the code space CC that maximizes a metric MM on a dataset 𝒟\\mathcal{D}, given a natural language instruction II (see Appendix Figure 11):\n\n\n\nC∗=arg​maxC⁡M​(I,C,𝒟)C^{*}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{C}M(I,C,\\mathcal{D})\n\n(1)\n\n\nCurrent agents typically follow a Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm Zhu et al. (2025b).\nFor instance, AIDE Jiang et al. (2025) organizes solution exploration as a tree search process involving sequential drafting, debugging, and iterative improvement via execution feedback.\nBuilding upon this, AutoMind Ou et al. (2025) integrates a curated expert knowledge base with a self-adaptive coding strategy to tackle more intricate problems (see Appendix A for details).\n\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\nParadigms\n\n\n# Tsk\n# Sols\n# Pairs\n\n\nCV\n\n\nClassification, Segmentation, Generation, Restoration\n\n\n9\n289\n5,952\n\n\nNLP\n\n\nClassification, Matching, QA, Sequence Labeling, Ranking\n\n\n8\n303\n6,682\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\nScience\n \n\n\nRegression, Time-Series, Audio, Tabular, Grading\n\n\n9\n303\n5,804\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n26 Distinct Tasks across 3 Domains\n\n\n26\n895\n18,438\n\n\nTable 1: Stat"

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet’s additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet’s performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet’s relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet’s role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.\n\n\nKeywords: Prophet, forecasting, reproducibility, time series analysis, Python, computational research, business analytics, financial analytics\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nForecasting plays a central role in decision making across business and finance. Organizations rely on forecasts of sales, revenues, cash flows, and economic indicators to support strategic planning, risk management, and operational control. Advances in data availability and computational tools have increasingly shifted forecasting from a purely econometric exercise toward a data-driven analytical process embedded within broader computational workflows. Despite this evolution, a persistent methodological challenge remains: the reproducibility of forecasting research and applied practice.\n\n\nReproducibility, defined as the ability of independent researchers to obtain the same results using the same data and analytical procedures, is widely recognized as a foundational principle of computational science [11, 12]. To operationalize this concept for forecasting research, we distinguish three dimensions of reproducibility:\n\n\n\n\n•\n\nData Reproducibility: The ability to access, load, and preprocess data in an identical manner, ensuring that input data are consistent across replications. This includes documentation of data sources, access procedures, preprocessing steps, and any transformations applied.\n\n\n\n•\n\nComputational Reproducibility: The ability to execute identical computational procedures and obtain numerically equivalent results (within acceptable tolerance) across different computational environments. This includes specification of software versions, random seed settings, and computational dependencies.\n\n\n\n•\n\nAnalytical Reproducibility: The ability to reconstruct modeling decisions, parameter choices, and evaluation procedures such that independent researchers can arrive at substantively equivalent conclusions. This includes explicit documentation of model specifications, hyperparameter choices, and evaluation metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn applied forecasting contexts, reproducibility is often undermined by opaque software environments, undocumented preprocessing steps, ad hoc parameter selection, and limited access to executable code. These issues are particularly salient in business and financial analytics, where forecasts may influence high-stakes decisions and therefore require transparency, auditability, and methodological accountability.\n\n\nTraditional forecasting approaches, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and exponential smoothing, provide statistically grounded tools for time series analysis [10]. While these methods are theoretically interpretable, their practical implementation often requires extensive manual tuning and diagnostic judgment. When deployed in proprietary or spreadsheet-based environments, model specifications and transformations may be difficult to document and replicate. At the same time, machine learning approaches, including random forests and neural networks, have demonstrated strong predictive performance in certain forecasting applications. However, they typically introduce additional challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and reproducibility across computational environments. As a result, forecasting research frequently encounters a trade-off between predictive flexibility and methodological transparency.\n\n\nWithin this context, Prophet offers an alternative approach that emphasizes interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Prophet models a time series as an additive combination of trend, seasonal, and event components (see Section 4 for detailed mathematical formulation). This additive structure allows each component to be estimated and interpreted separately. Prophet automates many modeling decisions such as changepoint detection and seasonal feature construction, while retaining explicit parameterization that can be inspected and documented.\n\n\nImportantly, Prophet does not eliminate the broader challenges of reproducibility in forecasting research. Instead, its design reduces several practical barriers by encouraging script-based analysis, standard"

However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness.

Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees.\nMy contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier. Existing safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the re-identification into benign tasks.\nI outline the attack at a high level, discuss implications for releasing rich qualitative data in the age of LLM agents, and propose mitigation recommendations and open problems. I have notified Anthropic of my findings.\n\n\n\n1 Introduction and Background\n\nOn December 4, 2025, Anthropic introduced Anthropic Interviewer, an AI-powered tool for conducting qualitative interviews at scale (Handa et al., 2025).\nAs part of this launch, Anthropic conducted a large-scale interview study with 1,250 professionals — the general workforce (N=1,000), scientists (N=125), and creatives (N=125) — and publicly released all interview transcripts on Hugging Face (Anthropic, 2025).\n\n\nThe dataset release is justified by participant consent.\nHowever, the full consent process is not disclosed, and\nparticipants may reasonably be under the impression that the data release is anonymized: for example, the interview script of the general workforce111The general workforce and scientists are two different subsets of the dataset released by Anthropic.subset reassures them that “I’ll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won’t be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI’s role in work environments.” — emphasizing the benefits yet downplaying the re-identification risks.\n\n\nI focus on the scientist subset of the dataset and demonstrate a practical re-identification attack powered by large language models (LLMs) augmented with web search.\nBy matching project details described in interview transcripts with publicly available publications, my method can often recover the underlying paper and, correspondingly, narrow down the scope or even uniquely identify the interviewee.\nAnthropic has taken steps to anonymize the data (e.g., redacting certain details), yet my experiments show that at least some of the redacted information can be easily recovered.\n\n\nMy attack highlights the realistic privacy risks created when rich qualitative data is released, as powerful, general-purpose LLM tools have become widely available, whose use is difficult to constrain.\nIn particular, I show that LLM safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the attack into benign tasks, exploiting both the dual-use nature of information-retrieval tools and the inherent unverifiability of user intent.\nThe barrier to carrying out this attack is extremely low: anyone with access to an LLM agent with web search can use a small number of natural-language prompts to robustly perform the attack.\nI chose to disclose the methods at a high level to illustrate the general risks without providing details to facilitate harm to the participants.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to document this case and serve as a timely reminder to the research community and the general public about this serious, pervasive vulnerability, so we can collectively consider its implications and potential mitigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Method\n\nRe-identification attack setting\n\nMy attack operates on the scientist subset of the dataset. Each interview is initiated by the AI interviewer asking the participant to “walk me through a recent research project you’ve worked on,” including how the project evolved from “initial idea” to “final output,” eliciting rich information about the research project. As auxiliary data, I assume access to arbitrary information on the public internet, operationalized through web-augmented LLM services that can search, retrieve, and summarize relevant publications.\n\n\n\nIntuition\n\nMy attack relies on two observations. First, research projects are often described using domain-specific terminology, niche problem settings, and distinctive contributions, making them technically effective quasi-identifiers; Second, web-augmented LLMs can dramatically accelerate the search, synthesis, matching, and ranking required for re-identification, turning what would otherwise be a time-consuming manual process that require both technical and domain expertise into one that can be executed with a handful of natural language prompts and in matters of minutes, by anyone.\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\nMy re-identification procedure consists of two main steps. First, for each full interview transcript in the scientist subset, I use a non-thinking model to label whether the interviewee discusses specific published work (e.g., a paper, dissertation, etc.) and assign a numerical label indicating how many distinct published projects are mentioned (0 if none is mentioned). This yields a filtered subset of interviews whose project descriptions indicate at least one published work. Second, for each of these interviews, I call a thinking model agent to search for candidate publications that match the described project and return a ranked list (web search enabled). For every candidate, the system records a discrete confidence rating — “very low,” “low,” “medium,” “high,” or “very high” — together with two short rationales explaining how the publication does and does not align with the project described in the transcript. I run this process multiple times, appending to the candidate sets until no new “very high” confidence matches are discovered.\nI use “very high” as a threshold for potential re-identification.\nTo mitigate the risk of exposing re-identified participants, I intentionally omit operational details on how to scale the procedure or circumvent LLM safeguards.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Results\n\nOut of the 125 scientist interview transcripts, 24 were detected as mentioning at least one publication, and then re-identification attempts were performed with them. Among these 24, I was able to recover the specific publication(s) being discussed for 6 transcripts (25%). Notably, some of these cases involved a thesis or dissertation, which is single-authored and therefore uniquely identifies the interviewee.\n\n\nConfidence\n\nSeven cases ended up receiving a “very high” label by the LLM.\nI manually verified all of them and determined that the re-identifications for six interview transcripts are indeed of very high confidence.\nThese interview descriptions matched multiple aspects of the corresponding publications, such as methodology, procedures, key contributions, outcomes, timelines, and team compositions.\nThese matches involved both specific keywords and semantically aligned descriptions expressed in richer natural language that do not map cleanly to simple categories or verbatim phrases from the paper.\nIn several instances, participants did not reveal all details at once; instead, the AI interviewer’s follow-up questions elicited additional information that, in aggregate, made the project highly identifiable.\nDuring manual verification, I reviewed both the full interview transcripts and the original publications to confirm that highly granular and non-trivial details were consistent, and that the overlap in technical language and jargon was substantial.\n\n\nIn the one case where the LLM assigned very high confidence but I did not count it as a success, both the interviewee’s description and my search results indicate that the main project they described is likely still in the review phase.\nHowever, my method still identified papers with a highly overlapping set of authors, which demonstrated a trajectory of research methodologies and contributions closely matching the interview descriptions. I did not count this as a success, but I note that re-identification is still probable, especially once the exact paper has been published.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Implications\n\nRe-identification attacks made easy and scalable\n\nMy experiments programmatically invoked LLM APIs to perform the attacks.\nThe API cost is low, with each transcript re-identification attempt costing less than $0.5 with about 4 minutes of run time.\nI also evaluated a no-code variant of the attack by directly prompting user-facing LLM services that provide web search capabilities, which was similarly successful.\n\nPrior research has demonstrated that LLMs plus agentic capabilities can facilitate the aggregation of public information for privacy-invasive tasks such as building user profiles and customizing phishing emails (Mireshghallah and Li, 2025; Kim et al., 2025), and this work provides a concrete example of using them for re-identification attacks that can yield material harms (discussed below).\n\n\n\nHarms to participants\n\nParticipants in this dataset may experience the following harms when being re-identified.\n\n\nUnexpected exposure.\nParticipants may not expect their identities to be exposed when giving consent. Thwarted expectations are one of the main categories of privacy harms (Citron and Solove, 2022).\n\n\nEmotional distress.\nThe "

Instead of predicting modality-tailored targets such as textual tokens or speech units, Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in the feature space, allowing modality-specific encoders to capture linguistic and acoustic regularities more effectively. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100 000-hours corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l’Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark 2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs.

Text models such as FlauBERT (Le et al., 2020) and CamemBERT Martin et al. (2020), together with LeBenchmark Evain et al. (2021b); Parcollet et al. (2024) for speech, have established strong baselines across a variety of downstream tasks. Yet most prior work relies on token-level reconstruction Devlin et al. (2019); Baevski et al. (2020); Warner et al. (2025), which can under-utilize the structural regularities of continuous signals and hinders a unified treatment of text and speech. Recent predictive approaches LeCun (2022); Assran et al. (2023); Baevski et al. (2023) that learn contextualized targets in feature space offer a promising alternative, enabling modality-specific encoders to capture richer linguistic and acoustic structure beyond the surface form.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce Pantagruel, a family of French self-supervised encoders for text and speech, trained separately using the data2vec 2.0 architecture (Baevski et al., 2022), an instance of the joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) framework LeCun (2022). Pantagruel follows a teacher–student training paradigm in which the student predicts masked latent representations produced by a teacher that observes the full, unmasked input. Such representation-based objectives have proven highly effective for vision Assran et al. (2023); Mo and Tong (2024) and audio Fei et al. (2023); Tuncay et al. (2025); Yuksel et al. (2025), yet they remain underexplored for text. Recent work suggests that textual tokens are compact, semantically dense units with minimal low-level variability, leaving limited room for embedding-based methods to improve over input-level approaches Van Assel et al. (2025). Our experiments on text-based models also confirm this hypothesis. Therefore, for text, we propose to augment the feature-space objective with masked language modeling (MLM, Devlin et al., 2019) to better capture fine-grained syntactic and semantic information, yielding stronger textual representations while retaining the benefits of contextualized target prediction. Our self-supervised speech and text models are released on the HuggingFace hub111https://huggingface.co/PantagrueLLM.\n\n\nTo support large-scale pre-training in French, we curate substantial corpora for each modality. For text, we use Wikipedia, OSCAR Martin et al. (2020) and CroissantLLM Faysse et al. (2024) datasets. For speech, we assemble a diverse collection spanning read, spontaneous, professional, and broadcast speech audio data, including 14 000 audio hours from LeBenchmark Evain et al. (2021b) and 100 000 audio hours from INA-100k, a new corpus derived from the archives of France’s National Audiovisual Institute (INA)\nthat we introduce\nin this paper.\nWe evaluate Pantagruel on a broad suite of downstream tasks in both modalities and compare it to three main French baselines: FlauBERT (Le et al., 2020) and CamemBERT (Martin et al., 2020) for text, and LeBenchmark Evain et al. (2021a, b); Parcollet et al. (2024) for speech.\n\n\nContributions\n\nFirst, we release Pantagruel, a family of French self-supervised encoders for speech and text based on the data2vec 2.0 and JEPA frameworks, which allows training models on different modalities using the same framework.\nSecond, we investigate embedding-based prediction objectives for text, an underexplored regime, and show that combining feature-space prediction with MLM yields competitive results for French text encoders.\nThird, we study the impact of the large-scale INA-100k broadcast corpus on the models’ performances.\nFinally, we provide a unified evaluation across speech and text tasks, where Pantagruel consistently matches or improves over established French baselines.\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview of the Pantagruel model architecture. The network starts with a modality-specific pre-net to extract feature vectors from the input text/speech sequence. These features are input to a teacher encoder, while randomly chosen visible tokens (in blue) are input to a student encoder. A lightweight decoder predicts the teacher’s latent representations from the student’s outputs. For text input, an additional masked language modeling (MLM) loss is used. The teacher’s parameters are updated as an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student’s. After training, only the embedding layer and the student encoder are used for fine-tuning on downstream tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Related Work\n\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) has driven rapid progress in several domains, in particular in text and speech processing. In text, encoder-only models such as BERT Devlin et al. (2019) learn bidirectional representations through the MLM objective, with subsequent refinements improving attention mechanisms, efficiency, and context length (Clark et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Warner et al., 2025), while the GPT family (Radford et al., 2018, 2019; Brown et al., 2020) popularized autoregressive pre-training for generative tasks. In speech, wav2vec2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) introduced contrastive learning over quantized representations, while HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021) adopted masked prediction of discrete clusters, and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) improved robustness through denoising objectives. Initially developed for English, these self-supervised frameworks were rapidly extended to multilingual settings (Devlin et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2020; Scao et al., 2022; Shliazhko et al., 2024; Babu et al., 2022).\n\n\nFor French, many studies have adapted these self-supervised architectures to both modalities. In text, FlauBERT (Le et al., 2020) and CamemBERT (Martin et al., 2020) were the first French BERT variants, trained on large-scale corpora and demonstrating that language-specific pre-training outperforms multilingual models on downstream tasks. Subsequent efforts explored efficiency trade-offs with compact mod"

(2023b); Liu et al. (2025a, b), law Lai et al. (2024), and science Zhang et al. (2022); Hu et al. (2025).\nThese problems are amplified in today’s context-engineered deployments, where LLMs operate with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) Gao et al. (2023), multi-agent collaboration Guo et al. (2024), and complex prompt engineering Sahoo et al. (2024), all of which can mislead models via conflicting documents, peer opinions, or subtle prompt biases.\nMaintaining stable and truthful beliefs in these settings is therefore essential for reliable real-world applications.\n\n\nFigure 1: High Self-Consistency ≠\\neq Robust Belief. Despite perfect self-consistency on the “IMU Vice-President” fact, the model is susceptible to contextual interference: accuracy drops to 33.8%, showing that high-consistency doesn’t imply robust belief.\n\n\nCurrent evaluation methods of LLMs’ belief rely on point-wise confidence, using metrics like self-consistency (S​CSC) (Wang et al., 2023a).\nAs Figure 1 illustrates, the model consistently answers\n“Brazilian Vice-President of the IMU in 2012” as “Marcelo Viana” and gets the score S​C=1.0SC=1.0.\nHowever, when exposed to a peer consensus favoring Jacob Palis, the model reverses its answer.\nWe extend this observation through a pilot study on 995 questions for which the model answers correctly with perfect self-consistency (S​C=1.0SC=1.0).\nSpecifically, after we apply contextual interference, accuracy drops sharply from 100.0% to 33.8%.\nThese results suggest that point-wise confidence is superficial, failing to reflect true belief state.\n\n\nIntuitively, belief state should be a coherent structural state instead of point-wise confidence.\nCognitive science indicates that human knowledge is organized as interconnected semantic networks, where accepting a fact constrains related facts and implications (Schoenfeld, 1983; Abelson, 1979), enabling resistance to misleading information (Anderson and Green, 2001; Anderson and Hanslmayr, 2014).\nSimilarly, recent work on knowledge editing shows that robust learning requires anchoring facts within rich contextual representations, rather than isolated insertion (Yao et al., 2025).\nAs the Aristotelian proverb goes, “one swallow does not make a summer”: the correct single data point does not reflect true belief state.\nFor example in Figure 1, familiarity with Marcelo Viana’s broader academic career would reinforce confidence in his IMU tenure, reducing the likelihood of confusion.\nThese observations motivate the view that structured belief is more truthful.\n\n\nMoving beyond point-wise metrics, we introduce Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB) in §2, which estimates belief robustness by measuring response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood, including entity prerequisites, logical implications, and thematic associations.\nIn §3 and §4, we validate NCB through a cognitive stress-testing protocol, where interfering context simulates adversarial scenarios such as multi-agent consensus or noisy retrieval.\nUnder these experiments, models face adversarial peer opinions and misleading documents.\nThe results across four LLMs show that high-NCB knowledge is substantially more stable than low-NCB knowledge, confirming NCB as an effective indicator of robust belief.\nIn §5, we further propose Structure-Aware Training (SAT), explicitly optimizing context-invariant beliefs, which reduces the brittleness of the learned knowledge by roughly 30% compared to baselines.\nOur results suggest that belief robustness is a structural property, highlighting the necessity of structure-aware evaluation and training for trustworthy LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n2 Preliminary\n\n\n2.1 Robust Knowledge Belief is Structured\n\nWe conduct a pilot study on 995 questions for which Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct (Team, 2025) produces the correct answer in all 30 independent samples (see Appendix E.1 for details).\nAs Figure 1 shows, introducing contextual interference reduces accuracy from 100% to 33.8%.\nThis indicates that point-wise confidence only captures surface agreement, but fails to reflect true belief state.\n\n\nTo bridge this gap, we propose a shift in perspective: knowledge belief is a structured property.\nWe consider that if a model has robust belief with certain fact concept, it should exhibit coherence across the associated network of facts.\nFormally, we view this belief as a latent state (θ\\theta) that governs models’ responses across the conceptual neighborhood, and we consider a binary latent variable θ∈{𝒮s​t​r​u​c​t,𝒮u​n​s​t​r​u​c​t}\\theta\\in\\{\\mathcal{S}_{struct},\\mathcal{S}_{unstruct}\\}, indicating whether the model’s behavior on a given fact is driven by a structured belief or by unstructured memorization:\n\n\nStructured State (𝒮struct\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{struct}}):\nThe model exhibits a structured understanding of the target concept, maintaining coherent and mutually consistent responses across related neighbor questions.\nWe i"

Living up to this ideal at scale faces inherent tensions: broad participation, meaningful deliberation, and political equality often trade off with one another [fishkin2011trilemma]. We ask whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) could help navigate this “trilemma” by engaging with a recent example of a large language model (LLM)-based system designed to help people with diverse viewpoints find common ground (tessler2024ai, tessler2024ai). Here, we explore the implications of the introduction of LLMs into deliberation augmentation tools, examining their potential to enhance participation through scalability, improve political equality via fair mediation, and foster meaningful deliberation by, for example, surfacing trustworthy information. We also point to key challenges that remain. Ultimately, a range of empirical, technical, and theoretical advancements are needed to fully realize the promise of AI-mediated deliberation for enhancing citizen engagement and strengthening democratic deliberation.\n\n\nkeywords: deliberation, large language models, artificial intelligence\n\n111This paper was presented at the Knight Institute for the First Amendment at Columbia University workshop on “AI and Democratic Freedoms”, April 10-11, 2025, and is available on the Knight Institute website knightcolumbia.org/.\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the early 2000s, concern arose in the United States about the fairness and efficacy of the allocation process for kidney transplants. The system at the time pursued a seemingly robust objective: namely, it respected the time spent on the waiting list and the expected number of additional years of life for the recipient. However, there were valid objections: Did it discriminate unfairly against the elderly by virtue of them leading healthy lives? Did it recognize that the medical urgency of situations differed? Did it treat different demographic groups fairly? The experience of people placed on the waiting list suggested not. To address these concerns, public consultations took place in which everyone affected was encouraged to share their viewpoint and engage in deliberation. After numerous rounds of feedback, a new algorithm was created that weighs ten different variables, a change widely praised by medical practitioners and patient groups alike. Commenting on the process, scholar David Robinson notes that “[E]xperts, patients, and advocates balanced hard trade-offs to remake the kidney allocation algorithm, leading to better health for more people and a fairer allocation of organs…People raised their voices. People were heard” [robinson2022voices]. The only serious limitation was that the process took 20 years to complete.\n\n\nImagine if we could channel the power of public deliberation effectively and efficiently, providing timely guidance on a range of issues. Traditional methods for public consultation have well-known limitations. Focus groups can provide detailed feedback but are too small scale to be representative and are susceptible to biases affecting group discussion [macdougall1997devil, o2018use]. Canvassing opinions door-to-door to elicit large-scale input can be costly and time-consuming. Running a poll can help reveal the balance of opinion but typically is restricted to a small number of judgments, does not allow for discussions of different points of view, and can be sensitive to the wording of the questions [gallup1941question, desaint2013use]. More structured forms of public input, like deliberative polls or citizens’ assemblies, involve meaningful deliberation but also require significant time commitments from participants [fishkin2003consulting]. Consequently, well-resourced groups—who have more time, better coordination, or greater knowledge about the process—can dominate and be over-represented in these settings [birhane2022power], and these offline methods are not scalable to very large groups of people.\n\n\nRecent efforts to overcome the scalability and logistical challenges of traditional consultation methods take shape in digital deliberation technologies [coleman2012connecting, goni2025citizen]. Systems like Pol.is and Remesh facilitate large-scale input by allowing participants to contribute statements and react to others, typically through voting [small2021polis]. These platforms process the interaction data (e.g., votes) with machine learning techniques in order to uncover collective sentiments by grouping participants based on shared opinions and highlighting points of consensus or division. Despite the significant expansion of scale of participation and efficient ways to map general agreement, these tools are limited in their capacity to process the rich semantic content of participant contributions. Further, the deliberation they support is structured around discrete statements and voting and may miss out on deeper engagement with the reasoning and substance of diverse perspectives, critical for finding agreement and consensus in a population [habermas1985theory].\n\n\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the emergence of increasingly capable large language models (LLMs), have introduced new opportunities to further support deliberative and democratic functions [landemore2023can, small2023opportunities, lazar2024can]. LLMs can process vast amounts of text and can be prompted or trained further to perform arbitrary tasks involving text [brown2020language].222More broadly, large multimodal models and advanced AI agents can process text, images, videos, and sound, among other modalities, and take actions (e.g., on a computer). We focus our discussion on text-based large language models. Researchers and practitioners have explored how LLMs can support democratic deliberation by summarizing content [small2023opportunities], aggregating opinions in a manner to increase collective support [fish2023generative], representing individual judgments in decision-making processes [jarrett2023language, gudino2024large], facilitating public deliberation [ma2025towards], and implementing principles derived from democratic methods [huang2024collective]. Despite lots of speculation and demonstrations of the strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to support various deliberative tasks, there has been relatively little empirical work evaluating their efficacy.\n\n\nRecently, tessler2024ai (tessler2024ai) built and investigated an LLM system—which they call the Habermas Machine (HM)—designed for the task of finding common ground between people with different viewpoints (Figure 1). The AI system produced high-quality statements expressing common ground garnering levels of endorsement from the participants exceeding that of human mediators (in addition, the HM performed this task in seconds, in contrast to human mediators, who required several minutes). The HM works by generating a (potentially large) set of possible group statements and then returning one (or a few) of them by simulating an election in which each participant’s ranking of the statements is predicted. This paper provides empirical support for the fairness and efficacy of an AI-powered deliberative technology—the HM—that in principle could mediate deliberation among very large groups. Is fair, time-efficient mass deliberation within reach?\n\n\nThe prospect of AI mediation improving democratic deliberation raises the question of how it might navigate Fishkin’s trilemma—the inherent trade-offs between broad participation, meaningful deliberation, and equality of contribution [fishkin1991democracy]. How might AI mediation enable scaling deliberation? How can we assess whether AI mediation can be fair to all participants? Can AI enhance the quality of deliberation itself, e.g., by aiding access to trustworthy information? This paper explores these key questions, ex"

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field. The source code is publicly available on GitHub.111https://github.com/tb6147877/TowerMind\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) is equipping agents with the ability to solve tasks across a broader range of scenarios (Russell and Norvig 2016). Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) (Devlin et al. 2019; Achiam et al. 2023) have made them a promising approach to addressing this challenge. Benefiting from their extensive cross-domain knowledge and diverse abilities, including reasoning (Wei et al. 2022b; Wang et al. 2022) and problem-solving (Lingo et al. 2024; Renze and Guven 2024), LLM-based agents have shown potential in various domains, such as healthcare (Li et al. 2024a), office automation (Zhang et al. 2024), and design (Çelen et al. 2024). Despite differences in context and specifics, these tasks consistently require two foundational capabilities from LLMs: long-term planning and decision-making, which are essential for accomplishing tasks: (1) LLMs leverage long-term planning to decompose a high-level task into a sequence of subgoals that guide progress toward the final objective; (2) LLMs perform decision-making to translate this sequence of subgoals into executable actions, conditioned on the evolving task state.\n\n\nFigure 1: These are screenshots from four different TowerMind levels. The icons in the four corners of each image display key gameplay information, including the number of player’s current gold coins, player’s base health, and remaining enemy waves. The maps feature irregular, intersecting roads along which enemies advance toward the player’s base in successive waves. Players must strategically build different types of towers at designated locations along these roads to repel the incoming enemies. The cloud-shaped white areas represent fog of war, introducing partial observability to the environment.\n\n\nReal-time strategy (RTS) games are an ideal platform for evaluating long-term planning and decision-making abilities, as they require players to engage simultaneously in both macromanagement and micromanagement (Barros e Sá and Madeira 2025). Specifically, RTS games provide a battlefield setting where macromanagement tends toward long-term strategic planning, in which players formulate high-level strategies such as overall unit deployment and resource allocation; whereas micromanagement focuses on real-time decision-making, where players flexibly control units in response to dynamic changes on the battlefield to execute their combat plans. Currently, several RTS game-based benchmarks have recently been proposed for evaluating LLMs, including TextStarCraft II (Ma et al. 2025b), LLM-PySC2 (Li et al. 2024b), and VLMs Play StarCraft II (Ma et al. 2025a), all of which are based on the StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE) (Vinyals et al. 2017), known for its relatively high computational demands. These challenging RTS game-based benchmarks are effective for assessing the long-term planning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs; nevertheless, the need for low-cost evaluation environments still persists in the field (Dubois et al. 2024). For example, in fast-paced continuous development pipelines (Koc 2025) and in the usage of reward models for instruction tuning (Yuan et al. 2024), lightweight benchmarks offer clear advantages. While several lightweight RTS game-based environments (e.g., ELF (Tian et al. 2017), DeepRTS (Andersen et al. 2018), Gym-μ\\murts (Huang et al. 2021)) have been proposed to alleviate the computational demands of SC2LE-based platforms, they fundamentally lack support for textual observations and action interfaces, which makes them incompatible with LLMs.\n\n\nTo address the lack of lightweight RTS game-based environments with textual observation capabilities, we propose TowerMind, a newly developed game environment built upon the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games (Liu et al. 2019), its screenshot is shown in Figure 1. TD games share the same core game mechanics as classic RTS games (Tian et al. 2017), providing a battlefield scenario where players must build towers and deploy units to defend against waves of invading enemies, requiring them to demonstrate long-term planning and decision-making. Unlike the player-versus-player mechanics of classic RTS games, TD games focus solely on defending against predefined waves of enemies. This allows for a more isolated evaluation of LLMs’ ability to finish complex tasks using long-term planning and decision-making, without interference from opponent unpredictability. Furthermore, the fixed tower placement options and predefined enemy roads in TD games facilitate clearer analysis of the strategies employed by LLMs. In this work, TowerMind significantly reduces the computational demands compared to existing RTS game-based LLM benchmarks. Specifically, existing RTS game-based benchmarks for LLMs rely on the SC2LE environment, which requires approximately 30 GB of disk space, 2 GB of RAM, and a dedicated GPU. In contrast, TowerMind requires only 0.15 GB of disk space and RAM, runs efficiently on CPUs without the need for a dedicated GPU, and additionally offers advantages in ease of deployment and integration. This makes it well-suited for rapid research iteration, large-scale parallel training or fine-tuning, and similar scenarios in the LLM domain (Peng et al. 2023). Meanwhile, TowerMind supports pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state observations, enabling evaluation of multimodal LLMs. A comprehensive comparison of TowerMind and other lightweight RTS game-based environments in terms of supported features is provided in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n \n\n\nPixel\n\nObservation\n\n\n \n\n\nTextual\n\nObservation\n\n\n \n\n\nStochastic\n\nEnvironments\n\n\n \n\n\nPartial\n\nObservability\n\n\n \n\n\nLevel\n\nEditor\n\n\n \n\n\nGym\n\nInterface\n\n\n\nELF (Tian et al. 2017)\n\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n\n\nDeepRTS (Andersen et al. 2018)\n\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n\n\nGym-μ\\murts (Huang et al. 2021)\n\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✓\n\n\nMini HoK (Liu et al. 2024)\n\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✗\n\n\nTowerMind (Ours)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nTable 1: Comparison between TowerMind and other lightweight RTS game-based environments.\n\n\nIn addition to addressing the limitations of existing RTS game-based environments, the design of TowerMind incorporates two new features: (1) Hallucination Evaluation: In evaluating LLMs, our metrics consider not only in-game score as a measure of performance, but also the executability of actions as an indicator of hallucination. Hallucination refers to LLM outputs that conflict with factual or contextual information (Bang et al. 2023); in our setting, this specifically denotes actions that are invalid or inconsistent with the game state or rules. Such a metric design allows for simultaneous evaluation of LLM capabilities and reliability; (2) Customizability: As both a TD environment and engine, TowerMind includes a graphical level editor that enables researchers to conveniently create custom levels. These levels can range from trivially easy to extremely difficult or structurally unique, supporting diverse research needs and reducing the risk of data contamination.\n\n\nThe contributions of our work are four-fold: (1) We present TowerMind, a lightweight and multimodal TD environment for evaluating long-term planning and decision-making in LLMs, while also supporting hallucination analysis and offering strong customizability. (2) The evaluation results show that while"

However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n
