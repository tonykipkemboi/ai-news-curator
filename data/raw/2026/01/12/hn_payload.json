      "&gt;The share of U.S. households reporting at least one user rose from about 11% in late 2023 to more than 16% by mid-2024.<p>I was wondering how you could get such a high impact overall. But it seems one in 6 households are on GLP-1 drugs in the US.<p>In my friend circle in Germany I don&#x27;t even know one single person on this stuff.<p>It&#x27;s insane to me that so many people need these to get off the processed foods killing them in the US.",
      "This headline is a touch misleading as it gives the impression of being across all US households, the quote is:<p>&gt;Within six months of starting a GLP-1 medication, households reduce grocery spending by an average of 5.3%. Among higher-income households, the drop is even steeper, at more than 8%. Spending at fast-food restaurants, coffee shops and other limited-service eateries falls by about 8%.",
      "&gt; “The data show clear changes in food spending following adoption,” Hristakeva said. “After discontinuation, the effects become smaller and harder to distinguish from pre-adoption spending patterns.”<p>It&#x27;s interesting that overall spending doesn&#x27;t decrease that much in the end, although shifting from snacks to fruit is the kind of change health advocates have always wanted?",

      "That is pretty astonishing given 10% of Americans use semaglutide &#x2F; tirzepitide.<p>&gt; Spending on savory snacks dropped by about 10%, with similarly large decreases in sweets, baked goods and cookies. Even staples like bread, meat and eggs declined.<p>I can&#x27;t read the paper (paywall), but that means something like the 10% of Americans who are on it must switch to purchasing almost no junk food.",

You&#x27;ll be keeping access and permissions where they belong, and not in a FUSE layer, and you won&#x27;t have to maintain a weird abstraction that&#x27;s annoying&#x2F;hampered with licensing issues if you want to deploy it cross platform.<p>Also, your simplified FUSE abstraction will not map accurately to the state of the world unless you&#x27;re really comprehensive with your implementation, and at that point, you might as well be interacting directly in order to handle that state accurately.",

You can optimise this and caching works after first fetch but the method is slow. The alternative is to leverage the existing API which will be million times faster. Now you could also create some kind of special file via fuse that acts like a search but it is weird and I don&#x27;t think the models will do well with something so obscure.<p>We went as much as implementing this idea in rust to really test it out and ultimately it was ditched because, well it sucks.",

      "The idea of Claude having &quot;anterograde amnesia&quot; and the top-rated comment there by Noosphere89 really resonated with me:<p><pre><code>  &quot;I would analogize this to a human with anterograde amnesia, who cannot form new memories, and who is constantly writing notes to keep track of their life. The limitations here are obvious, and these are limitations future Claudes will probably share unless LLM memory&#x2F;continual learning is solved in a better way.&quot;\n\n  This is an extremely underrated comparison, TBH. Indeed, I&#x27;d argue that frozen weights + lack of a long-term memory are easily one of the biggest reasons why LLMs are much more impressive than useful at a lot of tasks (with reliability being another big, independent issue).\n\n  It emphasizes 2 things that are both true at once: LLMs do in fact reason like humans and can have (poor-quality) world-models, and there&#x27;s no fundamental chasm between LLM capabilities and human capabilities that can&#x27;t be cured by unlimited resources&#x2F;time, and yet just as humans with anterograde amnesia are usually much less employable&#x2F;useful to others than people who do have long-term memory, current AIs are much, much less employable&#x2F;useful than future paradigm AIs.</code></pre>",

What next?&quot;<p>With opus 4.5 it&#x27;s not quite laughably as bad but still often misses very obvious problems.<p>It&#x27;s very interesting to see the rapid progression on these benchmarks, as it&#x27;s probably a very good proxy for &quot;agentic vision&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve came to the conclusion that browser use without vision (eg based on the DOM or accessibility trees) is a dead end, simply because &quot;modern&quot; websites tend to use a comical amount of tokens to render.

      "I think my take away is that you are seeing mostly mode-collapse here. There is a high consistency across all of the supposedly different personalities (higher than the naive count would indicate - remember the stochastic nature of responses will inflate the number of &#x27;different&#x27; responses, since OP doesn&#x27;t say anything about sampling a large number of times to get the true response).",
      "A related  trick - if you want to teach your agent a specific kind of behavior, and want this behavior to be calibrated and safe, what you can do is:<p>1. enumerate the actions (policies) your agent takes, collected from prior runs<p>2. infer the states that correspond to each of these policies, make a state atlas (similar to the zodiac here)<p>3. infer the maximally discriminative features that can identify the state from current context<p>4. label a few examples and train a small policy model that predicts your action from those state features<p>I think LLMs should be used more often like this - as feature extractors for toy models, which can be used like tools. This way you can encode arbitrary logic in a small tool model that does not depend on the biases of the base model. For example this setup could power a &quot;skill&quot; to reliably implement your policy.<p>The trick here is that you carefully identify states that predict policy reliably, and features that distinguish between states, instead of using embeddings or pure LLM reasoning. You can decouple the logic from the feature extraction, and have it calibrated to your goals.<p>All 4 steps can be done by a coding agent with your supervision and zero coding. It&#x27;s LLM as generic feature extractor with small models sitting on top.",

Implication is more efficient (and richer) than simulation.<p>During development, when we first added Astrological signs to the characters, there was a discussion about whether we should invent our own original &quot;Sim Zodiac&quot; signs, or use the traditional ones, which have a lot of baggage and history (which some of the designers thought might be a problem).<p>Will Wright argued that we actually wanted to leverage the baggage and history of the traditional Astrological signs of the Zodiac, so we should just use those and not invent our own.<p>The way it works is that Will came up with twelve archetypal vectors of personality traits corresponding to each of the twelve Astrological signs, so when you set their personality traits, it looks up the sign with the nearest euclidian distance to the character&#x27;s personality, and displays that as their sign. But there was absolutely no actual effect on their behavior.<p>That decision paid off almost instantly and measurably in testing, after we implemented the user interface for showing the Astrological sign in the character creation screen, without writing any code to make their sign affect their behavior: The testers immediately started reporting bugs that their character&#x27;s sign had too much of an effect on their personality, and claimed that the non-existent effect of astrological signs on behavior needed to be tuned down.
