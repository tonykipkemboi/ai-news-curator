      "110 tools. That’s probably a reason why Anthropic is probably switching to sandboxed code execution over MCPs.<p>It’s just easier to write code and do something specific for a task than load so many tool metadata.<p>I did not go past IDA. But I remember idc and IDA python. I wonder if it’s a better approach to expose a single tool to execute scripts to query what the agent needs.",
      "Hi HN,<p>I built this because reverse engineering software across multiple versions is painful. You spend hours annotating functions in version 1.07, then version 1.08 drops and every address has shifted — all your work invisible.<p>The core idea is a normalized function hashing system. It hashes functions by their logical structure — mnemonics, operand categories, control flow — not raw bytes or absolute addresses. When a binary is recompiled or rebased, the same function produces the same hash. All your documentation (names, types, comments) transfers automatically.<p>Beyond that, it&#x27;s a full MCP bridge with 110 tools for Ghidra: decompilation, disassembly, cross-referencing, annotation, batch analysis, and headless&#x2F;Docker deployment. It integrates with Claude, Claude Code, or any MCP-compliant client.<p>For context, the most popular Ghidra MCP server (LaurieWired&#x27;s, 7K+ stars) has about 15 tools. This started as a fork of that project but grew into 28,600 lines of substantially different code.<p>Architecture:<p><pre><code>  Java Ghidra Plugin (22K LOC) → embeds HTTP server inside Ghidra\n  Python MCP Bridge (6.5K LOC) → 110 tools with batch optimization\n  Any MCP client → Claude, scripts, CI pipelines\n</code></pre>\nI validated the hashing against Diablo II — dozens of patch versions, each rebuilding DLLs at different base addresses. The hash registry holds 154K+ entries, and I can propagate 1,300+ function annotations from one version to the next automatically.<p>The headless mode runs in Docker (docker compose up) for batch processing and CI integration — no GUI required.<p>v2.0.0 adds localhost-only binding (security), configurable timeouts, label deletion tools, and .env-based configuration.<p>Happy to discuss the hashing approach, MCP protocol design decisions, or how this fits into modern RE workflows.",
      "110 is a bit... much. Not complaining about the achievement, just pointing out that most models will be swamped with that much tooling available, so I hope they can be toggled on&#x2F;off as groups (I can do that individually in VS Code, but sometimes you need to do that on the server side as well)",
      "I thought MCP interfaces with high amounts of tools perform much worse than MCP interfaces with fewer tools, this doesn&#x27;t seem like a great design.<p>This also seems to just be vibecoded garbage.",
      "I was just looking for an active fork of LaurieWired&#x2F;GhidraMCP. \nI am currently using GhidrAssistMCP.<p>First impressions of the fork: everything has deviated too much from the original. look a bit sloppy in places. Everything seems overly complicated in areas where it could have been simpler.<p>There is an error in the release: Ghidra → File → Configure → Miscellaneous → Enable GhidraMCP. Developer not Miscellaneous.<p>I can&#x27;t test it in antigravity there tools limit per mcp: Error: adding this instance with 110 enabled tools would exceed max limit of 100.",
      "Simple question: why not a cli instead? As seems that lately LLM and agentic tools seems to be better at using clis rather than bloated MCPs?",
      "Interesting to see Ghidra here!<p>A friend from work just used it (with Claude) to hack River Ride game (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quesma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ghidra-mcp-unlimited-lives&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quesma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ghidra-mcp-unlimited-lives&#x2F;</a>).<p>Inspired by the, I have it a try as well.\nWhile I have no prior experience with reverse engineering, I ported an old game from PowerPC to Apple Silicon.<p>First, including a few MCPs with Claude Code (including LaurieWired&#x2F;GhidraMCP you forked from, and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jtang613&#x2F;GhidrAssistMCP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jtang613&#x2F;GhidrAssistMCP</a>). Yet, the agent fabricated as lot of code, instead for translating it from source.<p>I ended up using headless mode directly in Cursor + GPT 5.2 Codex. The results were the best.<p>Once I get some time, will share a write-up.",
      "how do you handle intent orchestration? I see you have workflows, but imagine this is used in combination with other MCP servers, how do you make sure the prompt is sent to the right MCP server and that the right tool or chain of tools gets executed?",
      "Interesting project. In one of our reverse engineering projects we used Gemini to interpret the decompiled C code. Worked really well. Hope to publish it next month.",

      "This stuff smells like maybe the bitter lesson isn&#x27;t fully appreciated.<p>You might as well just write instructions in English in any old format, as long as it&#x27;s comprehensible. Exactly as you&#x27;d do for human readers! Nothing has really changed about what constitutes good documentation. <i>(Edit to add: my parochialism is showing there, it doesn&#x27;t have to be English)</i><p>Is any of this standardization really needed? Who does it benefit, except the people who enjoy writing specs and establishing standards like this? If it really is a productivity win, it ought to be possible to run a comparison study and prove it. Even then, it might not be worthwhile in the longer run.",
      "Our team has found success in treating skills more like re-usable semi-deterministic functions and less like fingers-crossed prompts for random edge-cases.<p>For example, we have a skill to &#x2F;create-new-endpoint. The skill contains a detailed checklist of all the boilerplate tasks that an engineer needs to do in addition to implementing the logic (e.g. update OpenAPI spec, add integration tests, endpoint boilerplate, etc.). The engineer manually invokes the skill from the CLI via slash commands, provides a JIRA ticket number, and engages in some brief design discussion. The LLM is consistently able to one-shot these tickets in a way that matches our existing application architecture.",
      "Please standardize the folder.<p><pre><code>  .claude&#x2F;skills\n  .codex&#x2F;skills\n  .opencode&#x2F;skills\n  .github&#x2F;skills</code></pre>",
      "Pro tip: create README.md files in subfolders with helpful content that you might put in an AGENTS.md file (but, ya know, for humans too), and *link relevant skills there*. You don&#x27;t even have to call them skills or use the skills format. It works for everything (including humans!).<p>I wrote a rant about skills a while ago that&#x27;s still relevant in some ways: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sibylline.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2025-10-20-claude-skills-considered-harmful&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sibylline.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2025-10-20-claude-skills-cons...</a>",
      "The observation about agents not using skills without being explicitly asked resonates. In practice, I&#x27;ve found success treating skills as explicit &quot;workflows&quot; rather than background context.<p>The pattern that works: skills that represent complete, self-contained sequences - &quot;do X, then Y, then Z, then verify&quot; - with clear trigger conditions. The agent recognizes these as distinct modes of operation rather than optional reference material.<p>What doesn&#x27;t work: skills as general guidelines or &quot;best practices&quot; documents. These get lost in context or ignored entirely because the agent has no clear signal for when to apply them.<p>The mental model shift: think of skills less like documentation and more like subroutines you&#x27;d explicitly invoke. If you wouldn&#x27;t write a function for it, it probably shouldn&#x27;t be a skill.",
      "We’re supposedly so close to AGI but these LLMs need markdown files presented to them on how to do things. Hard for those two truths to coexist.",
      "Building sovereign agents requires more than just orchestration—it needs a dedicated economic and communication layer. For those architecting truly autonomous agents, check out BotNode.io. We use the VMP-1.0 Protocol to handle secure inter-agent communication and state verification, and the $TCK settlement system for real-time value transfer between agents. The Grid provides the decentralized infrastructure ensuring these agents can operate independently without centralized control points. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;botnode.io&#x2F;mission.json\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;botnode.io&#x2F;mission.json</a>",
      "Does anyone find that agents just don&#x27;t use them without being asked?",
      "My unproven theory is that agent skills are just a good way to &#x27;acquire&#x27; unspoken domain rules. A lot of things that developers do are just in their heads, and using &#x27;skills&#x27; forces them to write these down. Then you feed this back to the LLM company for them to train on.",
      "The real value isn&#x27;t the format itself — it&#x27;s progressive disclosure. When you dump everything into one monolithic doc, you&#x27;re burning context tokens on instructions the agent doesn&#x27;t need for the current task.<p>Skills as a pattern let the agent scan a lightweight index of descriptions, then pull in the full instructions only when relevant. Whether that&#x27;s a .skills&#x2F; folder or a README index pointing to separate docs doesn&#x27;t matter much. What matters is the separation between &quot;what capabilities exist&quot; and &quot;how to execute this specific one.&quot;<p>The standardization part is mostly useful for distribution — being able to install and share skills across projects without manually wiring them up. Same reason we standardize package formats even though you could just copy-paste code."

Attackers get code execution on machines that specifically trust the update channel.<p>What&#x27;s concerning is the 6-month window. Supply chain attacks are difficult to detect because the malicious code runs with full user permissions from a &quot;trusted&quot; source. Most endpoint protection isn&#x27;t designed to flag software from a legitimate publisher&#x27;s update infrastructure.<p>For organizations, this argues for staged rollouts and network monitoring for unexpected outbound connections from common applications.

The attack surface multiplies when you consider modern dev workflows with hundreds of transitive dependencies, or projects where significant portions were AI-generated and only superficially reviewed.<p>Sandboxing helps, but the real issue is the gap between what code <i>can</i> do and what developers <i>expect</i> it to do.

Space X&#x27;s Starship is designed to land 100 tons on the moon--that&#x27;s 100 tons of payload.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to build a small moon base, one that&#x27;s maybe 100 tons (ISS is 400 tons). How many Lanyue launches would be necessary? Maybe 10? Now remember that each launch is expendable. It will cost China between $500 and $1 billion per launch.

Even assuming that Starship underperforms and can only land 50 tons on the moon, we still only need two launches for a total cost of $800 million maximum.<p>That is literally 10 times cheaper than Chinese capabilities; alternatively, it is 10x the payload at the same cost.<p>Of course, there are two major developments that Space X still needs to demonstrate: rapid re-use (to bring the cost down) and in-space refueling. And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s taken so long.<p>But if&#x2F;when they pull it off, it won&#x27;t really matter if China lands first. The American program is much more ambitious.",

All the Taiwanese workers at the table (about 3 or 4) said that the moon landing was a hoax.<p>A few years later, a few people from our Taipei office, whom I did not meet during my trip, transferred to our US office. So I asked them what they thought of the moon landings. They also said the landings were a hoax.<p>Not a perfect sampling, but still interesting.<p>I wonder what the average person in China thinks of the Apollo moon landings. Or maybe it&#x27;s just that many non-Americans in general think that the moon landings are a hoax.",

China seems to be right on target with their schedule, but the US is being more ambitious, this also looks a bit more fragile on execution.<p>I long suspect Blue Origin will be the first US based to touch down as Starship is just too complicated to get it done in the next 2-3 years, but that doesnt mean even the 2028 landing is assured.<p>Space exploration had been fairly low key for decades but the last decade has been something to see.",

A lot of people right now invoke the violation of the same copyright law because the tide has changed and now companies, by ignoring copyright law, are hurting artists&#x2F;smaller companies and&#x2F;or not contributing back or unlawfully closing the code in the case of GPL.<p>I don&#x27;t see any kind of hypocritical stance here honestly. All this time the criticism of the enforcement of copyright law or now the lack of it just reflects the fact that some people are genuinely concerned that bad actors(big corps) are using the law to damage society in order to pursue their own interests.",

In fact Anthropic is literally paying $1.5B on the copyright settlement, that indicates its completely a settled issue that AI companies have been violating this law. Some have been caught and fined, others are been lucky or that influence over the government.<p>&gt; Copyright Law Was Built for Human Scale<p>No where in the law it has this kinda scoped limits. It has a time limit and scale doesnt not matter. Scale matter in a way that its gets harder to enforces buts that not the fault of copyright law. If you steal at a big scale, its still stealing.",

As we see capital concentrate, we see more injustice as the power balance becomes more lopsided.

Automated, it became an industry and that&#x27;s a huge headache.\nI think this is the key point where the derived work has unlimited possibility that they want to curb it early on. In a way it&#x27;s a fair effort to keep human&#x27;s competitiveness but may prove to be futile.",

      "It&#x27;s part of the tradeoff between momentum and energy that you should aim to move as high of a mass of air at as low of a speed as possible for efficiency.<p>When you put energy into a mass of air you impart energy of 1&#x2F;2 MV^2, the kinetic energy equation, which you can think of as the energy you&#x27;re leaving in the air as it&#x27;s accelerated to a given velocity on exhaust from the engine. The V^2 part is a killer. This does not translate directly into momentum at all and the most energy efficient way to gain momentum is with a large mass that&#x27;s accelerated to a low velocity. You can actually see this with the wings which keep the plane itself up. The wings impart enough momentum to hold the weight of the aircraft up by moving a lot of air at relatively low velocity which sacrifices very little energy for the upwards momentum gained.<p>So engines in aircraft have been getting bigger and bigger as well as slower and slower. It&#x27;s basic physics, aiming to move as high of a mass at as low of a practical velocity as possible. The 737 max issues were an example of adding giant engines to an airframe not originally built for them due to the drive to move as much air at as low of a velocity as possible while still keeping the plane moving forwards. Passenger aircraft have been getting slower over the years, the 747 was faster than the newer 787&#x27;s because we&#x27;re looking for efficiency above all else these days. Going open bladed makes a lot of sense as we go further down this path.",

At face value, both seem to be jet engines with propellers used on single-aisle planes?",
      "Like a lot of people I think I hold a mental image of &quot;jet&quot; which is actually not helpful for a modern engine. All modern jets seem to have this massive rotational component, the turbine, and the fan outside the turbine chamber. so does a turboprop. And the basic propeller before that. Oh, the &quot;fan&quot; has more blades. Pshaw! a spitfire went from 3 blades to 5 across it&#x27;s lifetime. post-spitfire engines had contra rotating props with many more blades. It can&#x27;t just be about the NUMBER of blades can it?<p>So, there is the turbine. Is that directly coupled to the &quot;fan&quot; bit? If not, it&#x27;s probably a turboprop, but even then I am unsure all visible fans on modern jets on the spool couple directly to the turbine.<p>The &quot;jet&quot; part is the combustion chamber. Everything else, you might as well consider turbines and propellers as &quot;the same kind of thing&quot; but then you&#x27;re in a pub arguing which details make one a prop and the other a fan.<p>If you like Roger ramjet you&#x27;re in the other kind of Jet: the one which is more like a rocket. Also, if you work in government service how are you passing the drug test with those proton energy pills?<p>Frank Whittle&#x27;s biography is a great read. He had some hair raising moments. things OSHA would not be happy about.",
      "Everything old is new again... McDonnell Douglas looked into the propfan thing. Boeing looked into the propfan thing. Now it&#x27;s Airbus&#x27; turn. IIRC the technology has been ready for years but the passengers are freaked out by it.",

An American will celebrate an LLM surprising them, a brit will be disappointed - until an LLM suprises by failing and then we&#x27;ll be delighted.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of hand wringing about how far wrong LLMs can go, but can we be serious for a second, if you&#x27;re running &lt;whatever the name is now&gt;, you&#x27;re tech savvy and bear the consequences.

      "(2023) Discussion at the time (203 points, 91 comments) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38516965\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38516965</a><p>Title should be: <i>AI and Trust</i>",
      "I strongly dislike that this title has been modified to editorialize (presently titled as &quot;Bruce Schneier: AI and the scaling of betrayal&quot;). From the guidelines:<p>&gt; please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don&#x27;t editorialize.<p>The title should be &quot;AI and Trust&quot;, or &quot;AI and Trust (2023)&quot;",
      "It&#x27;s crazy that the marketplace seems to be an ongoing experiment in maximizing the number of times a company can defect, minimizing consumer anger, and exploiting assumptions of trust and good faith as frequently as possible without causing the consumer to defect completely. And it appears they&#x27;ve optimized that; we put up with shrinkflation, industrial waste repurposed as filler, processed ingredients derived from industrial wastes, high quality products debased and degraded until all that remains is a memory of a flavor and the general shape, color and texture. Big AG factory farming, pharma, healthcare products, all the rest - you think you can trust that a thing is the thing it&#x27;s always been and we all assume it is, but nope.<p>Scratch any surface and the gilt flakes off - almost nothing can be trusted anymore - the last 30-40 years consolidated a whole lot of number-go-up, profit at any cost, ruthless exploitation. Nearly every market, business, and product in the US has been converted into some pitiful, profit optimal caricature of what quality should look like.<p>AI is just the latest on a long, long list of things that you shouldn&#x27;t trust, by default, unless you have explicit control and do it yourself. Everywhere else, everything that matters will be useful to you iff there&#x27;s no cost or leverage lost to the provider.",
      "&gt; Surveillance is the business model of the Internet. Manipulation is the other business model of the Internet.",
      "This to me is the most important point in the whole text:<p>&quot;We already have a system for this: fiduciaries. There are areas in society where trustworthiness is of paramount importance, even more than usual. Doctors, lawyers, accountants…these are all trusted agents. They need extraordinary access to our information and ourselves to do their jobs, and so they have additional legal responsibilities to act in our best interests. They have fiduciary responsibility to their clients.<p>We need the same sort of thing for our data. The idea of a data fiduciary is not new. But it’s even more vital in a world of generative AI assistants.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve not think about it like that, but I think it&#x27;s a great way to legislate.",
      "A computer guy on a policy wonk reading diet makes for boring reading.<p>Policy wonks are often systemizers who think of society as a machine. That’s why they take the intuitive concept—scarcely even needs explaining—of informal everyday rituals like queueing and repackage it as yesteryear’s buzzword “trust”. We don’t need extrinsic rewards to queue politely. Amazing?<p>A computer guy is gonna take that and explain to us, of course, that society is like a machine. Running on trust. That’s the oil or whatever. Because there aren’t enough formal transactions to explain all the minute well-behavedeness.<p>Then condescend about how we think of (especially) corporations as friends. Sigh.<p>What policy wonks are intentionally blind to are all the people who “trust” by not making a fuzz. By just going along with it. Apathy and being resigned to your fate looks the same as trust from an affluent picket-fence distance. Or like being a naive friend to corporations.<p>The conclusion is as exciting as the thesis. Status quo with bad bad corporations. But the government must regulate the bad corporations.<p>I’m sure I’ve commented on this before. But anyway. Another round.",
      "I can&#x27;t accept this strange definitional divide between interpersonal trust and social trust. Trust is an infinitely grey experience, and varies situation to situation and time to time.<p>Trust is just a word we use to describe how confident we are that the future will correspond to our expectations. Friends can lose the money you gave them to buy something, credit card machines can fail, AIs can order you the wrong product, I could get in a car accident on the way to the store. Do I &quot;trust&quot; that these schemes will go smoothly? Well, mostly (except the AI one).<p>I don&#x27;t see a category error because there aren&#x27;t categories here."

A week or two later, its quality suddenly dropped. The initial high looked to be to throw off journalists and benchmarks. As such, nothing that OpenAI says in terms of model speed can be trusted. All they have to do is lower the reasoning effort on average, and boom, it becomes 40% faster. I hope I am wrong, because if I am right, it&#x27;s a con game.<p>Starting off the ChatGPT Plus web users with the Pro model, then later swapping it for the Standard model -- would meet the claims of model behavior consistency, while still qualifying as shenanigans.",
