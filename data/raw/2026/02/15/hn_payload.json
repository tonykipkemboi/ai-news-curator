      "Very useful because the information is almost distribution agnostic as Arch will stick to upstream as much as possible; or at least that&#x27;s my impression as Debian user reading their wiki.<p>Also: isn&#x27;t the Arch wiki the new Gentoo wiki? Because that was <i>the wiki</i> early 2000s and, again, I&#x27;ve never used Gentoo!",
      "I learned linux by using Arch back in the days when pacman -Syu was almost certain to break something and there was a good chance it would break something unique to your install. This was also back in the days when most were not connected to the internet 24&#x2F;7 and many did not have internet, I updated when I went to the library which was generally a weekly thing but sometimes it be a month or two and the system breakage that resulted was rococo. Something was lost by Arch becoming stable and not breaking regularly, it was what drove the wiki and fixing all the things that pacman broke taught you a great deal and taught you quickly. Stability is not all that it is cracked up to be, has its uses but is not the solution to everything.",
      "The Arch wiki has rapidly become my go-to source for every time I need a real answer... and honestly it should just become my default for everything Linux. It&#x27;s <i>astoundingly</i> high quality, some of the best content out there whether or not you&#x27;re using Arch.<p>So +1000, I love their work, and all the contributors! It&#x27;s so, so good, and greatly appreciated.",
      "I also find myself using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.archlinux.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.archlinux.org&#x2F;</a> a lot. It&#x27;s much more readable&#x2F;user-friendly than <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org</a> plus it contains man-pages from their `extra` repo which contains a lot of popular oss tooling.",
      "I&#x27;ve had a Mac rather than a Linux machine at home for the last five or so years. Before that the arch wiki saved the day for me so many times.<p>Reading this has me looking for a junker laptop on eBay.",
      "I&#x27;ve never used Arch but I can really get the vibe here. Wikis (especially toopical ones) are social media of sorts. There was a strong community around the #emacs IRC channel and emacswiki.org back in the day. About a 100 people who knew each other quite well. And an Emacs bot that could read from the wiki (pre-modern RAG I suppose) and answer questions.",
      "I just hope they have robust backups and disaster-recovery plans, as Gentoo Wiki once had a terrible data loss, and it was like the burning of the Alexandria Library, I feel that put the distro to a decline. I don&#x27;t use Arch (I used Gentoo in those times), but these collaborative knowledge bases are too precious to be lost.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44900319\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44900319</a>",
      "The ArchWiki is indeed pretty good. I used to prefer the gentoo wiki\nback in the days but I think the ArchWiki may be better at this point\nin time.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to see that many other Linux distributions fail\nto have any wiki at all, yet alone one that has high quality content.\nThis is especially frustrating because Google search got so worse now\nthat finding resources is hard. I tried to explain this problem to\ndifferent projects in general; in particular ruby-based projects tend\nto have really low quality documentation (with some exceptions, e. g.\nJeremy Evans projects tend to have good quality documentation usually,\nbut that is a minority if you look at all the ruby projects - even\npopular ones such as rack, ruby-wasm or ruby opal; horrible quality\nor not even any real quality at all. And then rubyists wonder why \nthey lost to python ...)",
      "Their wiki is what sold me on Arch. I ended up there solving most of my problems on other distros, and if they can make such a fine wiki, I figured they could make a great OS (which they did).",
      "Genuinely, the wiki, and the AUR are the two killer features that keep me on Arch (not that I have any reasons to change). Arch is an incredibly polished distro, and is a real pleasure to use."

      "&gt; The idea is to have a chip with SRAM large enough <i>to fit the entire model</i>, so inference can happen entirely in-memory. [...] So how much internal memory does the latest Cerebras chip have? 44GB. This puts OpenAI in kind of an awkward position. 44GB is enough to fit a small model (~20B params at fp16, ~40B params at int8 quantization), but clearly not enough to fit GPT-5.3-Codex.<p>You don&#x27;t really need to fit the entire model on a single chip. Just as with GPUs, you can shard the model across multiple chips. Of course when you have a long pipeline of chips that each token needs to pass through, that decreases the end-to-end tokens per second correspondingly.<p>So the size of GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark isn&#x27;t limited by the memory of a single Cerebras chip, but the number of such chips that you can chain together and still hit the 1000 tokens per second target. Given that Cerebras offers models much larger than 40B at faster speeds <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cerebras.ai&#x2F;pricing#exploration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cerebras.ai&#x2F;pricing#exploration</a> GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is likely closer to GLM 4.7 in size. (≈355B total parameters, 32B active)",

This puts OpenAI in kind of an awkward position. 44GB is enough to fit a small model (~20B params at fp16, ~40B params at int8 quantization), but clearly not enough to fit GPT-5.3-Codex. That’s why they’re offering a brand new model, and why the Spark model has a bit of “small model smell” to it: it’s a smaller distil of the much larger GPT-5.3-Codex model.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>1.  Nvidia already sells e.g. the H100 with 80GB memory, so having 44GB isn&#x27;t an advance, let alone a differentiator.<p>2.  As I suspect anyone that&#x27;s played with open weights models will attest, there&#x27;s <i>no way</i> that 5.3-Codex-Spark is getting close to top-level performance and being sold in this way while being &lt;44GB.  Yes it&#x27;s weaker and for sure it&#x27;s probably a distil and smaller, but not by ~two orders of magnitude as suggested.",
      "One other thing I&#x27;d assume Anthropic is doing is routing all fast requests to the latest-gen hardware. They most certainly have a diverse fleet of inference hardware (TPUs, GPUs of different generations), and fast will be only served by whatever is fastest, whereas the general inference workload will be more spread out.",
      "Interesting theory. So how does ChatGPT begin responding instantly, as soon as I send the message? Shouldn&#x27;t it need to wait for the batch to fill? Or do they have so much traffic that this happens in a few ms?<p>(I think they might also be filling the message onto a GPU while you&#x27;re typing over a websocket or something, but I&#x27;m not sure.)",
      "The batch size explanation is wrong. Given how much Claude Code is used, finding fellow &quot;bus passengers&quot; is not an issue, you don&#x27;t need to wait.<p>The real reason which batching increases latency is multi-factored and more complex to explain.",
      "If the author is right, OpenAI have room for improvement where they can further improve the fast models for correctness for certain tasks while Anthropic are left with scaling vertically. OFC, it is likely that over time both approaches will converge when the companies understand the problem space better and what tradeoofs are worth making.<p>My personal take is that they will need a big model to plan and break down tasks and schedule them to specialized smaller models while there is a good enough model for real time interactions with the user, but it is the naive take and many other things might be shaping the decisions.",
      "This author thinks Cerebras chips were deployed at scale to serve users worldwide in just one month since the partnership announcement?<p>Seems like nonsense to me.",
      "Lol, without any evidence this is just vaporblog, it could just be reudced precision for whatever model either one of them runs &amp; not necessarily a distillation or smaller model to boot or heck even a combo since at this point in time most frontier models are MoEs &amp; getting absurd speeds for 1-20B experts is trivial regardless of batch sizes",
      "Another possible explanation, especially if quality degrades at all (I.e on openAI) is aggressive quantization.<p>Another possible explanation is speculative decoding, where you trade unused GPU memory for speed (via a drafting model).<p>But my money is on the exact two mechanisms the OP proposes."

More often than not I can identify when a team is in over their heads or think they’re just going to figure out the details later, after the money arrives.<p>For a period of time it was popular for the industrial designers I knew to try to launch their own Kickstarters. Their belief was that engineering was a commodity that they could hire out to the lowest bidder after they got the money. The product design and marketing (their specialty) was the real value. All of their projects either failed or cost them more money than they brought in because engineering was harder than they thought.<p>I think we’re in for another round of this now that LLMs give the impression that the software and firmware parts are basically free. All of those project ideas people had previously that were shelved because software is hard are getting another look from people who think they’re just going to prompt Claude until the product looks like it works.",

      "This guy bought an internet connected sleep mask so it&#x27;s not surprising that it was collecting all kinds of data, or that it was doing it insecurely (everyone should expect IoT anything to be a security nightmare) so to me the surprising thing about this is that the company actually bothered to worry about saving bandwidth&#x2F;power and went through the trouble of using MQTT. Probably not the best choice, and they didn&#x27;t bother to do it securely, but I&#x27;m genuinely impressed that they even tried to be efficient while sucking up people&#x27;s personal data.",
      "Ok, obviously unethical to do it, but this sounds like you&#x27;ve got the power to create some sci-fi shared dreaming device, where you can read people&#x27;s brainwaves and send signals to other people&#x27;s masks based on those signals. Or send signals to everyone at the same time and suddenly people all across the world experience some change in their dream simultaneously.<p>Like, don&#x27;t actually do it, but I feel like there&#x27;s inspiration for a sci-fi novel or short story there."

The only real loser is the common man who doesn&#x27;t have the resources to scrape the entire web himself.<p>I&#x27;ve sometimes dreamed of a web where every resource is tied to a hash, which can be rehosted by third parties, making archival transparent. This would also make it trivial to stand up a small website without worrying about it get hug-of-deathed, since others would rehost your content for you. Shame IPFS never went anywhere.",
      "I maintain an open-source project called Linkwarden and this exact discussion is one of the reasons why it exists, teams needed a way to preserve referenced URLs reliably without having to depend on external services.<p>It stores webpages in multiple formats (HTML snapshot, screenshot, PDF snapshot, and a fully dedicated reader view) so you’re not relying on a single fragile archive method.<p>There’s both a hosted cloud plan [1] which directly supports the project, and a fully self-hosted option [2], depending on how much control you need over storage and retention.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkwarden.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkwarden.app</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkwarden&#x2F;linkwarden\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkwarden&#x2F;linkwarden</a>",
