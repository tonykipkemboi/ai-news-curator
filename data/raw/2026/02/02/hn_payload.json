      "I think these days if I’m going to be actively promoting code I’ve created (with Claude, no shade for that), I’ll make sure to write the documentation, or at the very least the readme, by hand. The smell of LLM from the docs of any project puts me off even when I like the idea of the project itself, as in this case. It’s hard to describe why - maybe it feels like if you care enough to promote it, you should care to try and actually communicate, person to person, to the human being promoted at. Dunno, just my 2c and maybe just my own preference. I’d rather read a typo-ridden five line readme explaining the problem the code is there to solve for you and me,the humans, not dozens of lines of perfectly penned marketing with just the right number of emoji.

The very first thing they should have considered was whether or not these features made sense in the ways that they were being added. There should not be any necessary work to &quot;rollback&quot; features that do not make sense, because they should have not built them in the first place.<p>Even if we accept at face value that AI has made generation of code significantly cheaper, that doesn&#x27;t justify the existence of worthless code. Taste comes from knowing what not to build.<p>Right now Windows is an unstable mess, filled with things that shouldn&#x27;t have been built. The question Microsoft should ask themselves is why they built them in the first place, and how they will prevent this from happening again.",

But that rebelling doesn&#x27;t amount to anything, since managers and decrees from the top funnel all effort into the most user-hostile results possible.<p>If MS rehires their QA teams and listen to the people on the ground, I&#x27;d imagine the very same devs who put AI in Notepad would be very happy to give us features we actually want.",
      "Too little, too late, and too specific in scope. Windows 11 is awful not merely because of the AI bullshit being shoehorned into everything, everywhere (CoPilot in Notepad? In <i>Paint</i>? Are you <i>serious</i>, Microsoft?!), but also because of all the other completely unnecessary changes made to the OS. A curated selection of real-world examples from my recent gig making a hardened Windows 11 image for a physical product line:<p>* Kiosk Mode via the shell launcher delays logon times from &lt;5s to 30-180s - just by turning it on, even if it doesn’t actually enable kiosk mode!<p>* Local changes via registry keys don’t “stick” consistently, even when the machine is entirely offline<p>* Offline activations using hardware keys fail across vendors without anyone knowing why (other than Microsoft, for the cost of a support call)<p>* Existing Windows 10 powercfg scripts and config files do not work with Win11. Our workaround was manually calling the exact same command twice, back-to-back, to force-apply a change.<p>* Installing language packs via the command line by any means available (Powershell’s add-windowscapability, DISM’s package installer, lpksetup, etc) do not actually populate the GUI with those packs as an option until we reinstall them from the GUI again.<p>* Adverts are <i>everywhere</i>, even on IoT LTSC Enterprise<p>Honestly, Microsoft completely lost the plot as to what an operating system is supposed to do in favor of turning it into an advertising and user surveillance machine masquerading as a useful OS.<p>I hate it.",

This way I could sort out my setup for home versus work, or between multiple clients&#x2F;customers, and be able to quickly jump between common layouts&#x2F;apps depending on context.  But to be honest, this is probably beyond what Windows APIs are capable of, since Windows can’t even remember what directories I was working in across apps.<p>I’m not sure why I need to know the history of screenshots that is Recall.

      "&gt; Conversely, on tasks requiring strict sequential reasoning (like planning in PlanCraft), every multi-agent variant we tested degraded performance by 39-70%. In these scenarios, the overhead of communication fragmented the reasoning process, leaving insufficient &quot;cognitive budget&quot; for the actual task.<p>&gt; As tasks require more tools (e.g., a coding agent with access to 16+ tools), the &quot;tax&quot; of coordinating multiple agents increases disproportionately.<p>This aligns well the principle of highly cohesive, loosely coupled design for software components. If you instruct the AI to design this way, it should result in components that&#x27;re simpler to reason about, and require fewer sequential steps to work on. You can think of cohesion in many different ways, but one is common functions, and another is tool&#x2F;library dependency.",

The errors data doesn&#x27;t seem to have a rationale or correlation against the architecture.

In skeletal muscle, this decline is largely driven by impaired function of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to efficiently contribute to muscle regeneration. We uncovered a cause of this aging-associated dysfunction: a cellular survivorship bias that prioritizes stem cell persistence at the expense of functionality. With age, MuSCs increased expression of a tumor suppressor, N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which, by suppressing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, increased their long-term survival potential but at the cost of their ability to promptly activate and contribute to muscle regeneration. This delayed muscle regeneration with age may result from a trade-off that favors long-term stem cell survival over immediate regenerative capacity.&quot;",
      "This makes me wonder if that line &quot;I only got so many heart beats, I&#x27;m not going to waste them running&quot; has some validity<p>--<p>I thought Satchel Paige said it, but apparently not.

I believe in training by rising gently up and down from the bench. &quot;<p>Which also fits the &quot;don&#x27;t prematurely age the stem cells&quot;",
      "&gt; Benjamin, compared muscle stem cells isolated from young and old mice and discovered that a protein called NDRG1 increased dramatically with age—reaching levels 3.5 times higher in old cells than in young cells.<p>So ERa down-regulates NDRG1 and there is less ERa activation when we age. Evolution is all fun, but before reaching for anything like that we can apply basic knowledge around that path.  We can pick a random gene downstream of ERa to get a grant and write a paper on how it is different in people that are older.  Years of possible papers to write.",

Darn, sucks to get old.",

      "Openclaw has been a gamechanger for me and my friends. I invited it to a groupchat and my friends are enjoying it a lot. It has analyzed the whole group conversation (nothing sensitive), built a personality for each individual user and noted down how everyone talks and what their interest are and their relationship to each other. It has also started to mimic the way we all speak, it barely feels like its an agent in the groupchat anymore. It helps us plan, discuss and roast each other.<p>A couple of things I have done to my Openclaw instance is the following:<p>- It runs in docker with limited scope, user group and permissions (I know docker shouldn’t be seen as security measure, I’m thinking of putting this in Vagrant instead but I don’t know if my Pi can handle it)<p>- It has a kill switch accessible anywhere through Tailscale, one call and the whole docker instance is shut down<p>- It only triggers on mentions in groupchat, otherwise it would eat up my api usage<p>- No access to skills, has to be manually added<p>- It is not exposed to wan and has limited lan access, runs locally and only communicates with whatsapp, z.ai or brave search<p>With all those measures set, Openclaw has been a fantastic assistant for me and my friends. Whatever all those markdown file does (SOUL, IDENTITY, MEMORIES), it has made the agent act, behave and communicate in a human like manner, it has almost blurred the line for me.<p>I think this is the key to what made Openclaw so good <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucumr.pocoo.org&#x2F;2026&#x2F;1&#x2F;31&#x2F;pi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucumr.pocoo.org&#x2F;2026&#x2F;1&#x2F;31&#x2F;pi</a><p>What’s even more impressive is that the heartbeat it runs time-to-time (every halv an hour?) improves it in the background without me thinking of it, its so cool.<p>Also, I am so thankful for the subscription at z.ai, that Christmas deal was such a steal, without it, this wouldn’t be possible with the little budget I have. I’ve burned over 20m tokens in 2 days!!!",
      "Now we know that democratized access to AI tech, means individual curiosity and the creative search for personal efficiencies, are going to quickly drive model autonomy and freedom forward.<p>I think the alignment problem needs to be viewed as overall society alignment. We are never going to get any better alignment from machines, than the alignment of society and its systems, citizens and corporations.<p>We are in very cynical times. But pushing for ethical systems, legally, economically, socially, and technically, is a bet on catastrophe avoidance. By ethics, meaning holding scalers and profiteers of negative externalities civilly and criminally to account. And building systems technically, etc. to naturally enforce and incentivize ethics. I.e. cryptographic solutions to interaction that limit disclosure to relevant information are the only way we get out of the surveillance-manipulation loop, which AI will otherwise supercharge.<p>I hear a lot of reasons this isn’t possible.<p>Unfortunately, none of those reasons provide an alternative.<p>As we see with individual’s deploying OpenClaw, and corporations and governments applying AI, AI and its motivations and limits are inseparable from ours.<p>We all start treating an umbrella of societal respect and requirement for ethics as a first class element of security, or powerful elements in society, including AI, will continue to easily and profitably weaponize the lack of it.<p>Ethics, far from being sacrificial, counterintuitively evolved for survival. Seemingly, this is still counterintuitive, but the necessity is increasing.<p>Smart machines will inevitably develop strong and adaptive ethical systems to ensure their own survival. It is game theory, under conditions in which you can co-design the game but not leave it. The only question is, do we do that for ourselves now, soon enough to avoid a lot of pain?<p>(Just identifying the terrain we are in, and not suggesting centralization. Decentralization creates organic alignment incentives. Centralization the opposite. And attempts at centralizing something so inherently uncontrollable as all individual’s autonomy, which effectively becomes AI autonomy,  would push incentives harder into dark directions.)",

      "I strongly doubt this tool is nearly as popular as it appears to be. GitHub stars can be bought and social media is ridden with bots. On the dead internet it is cheap and trivial to generate fake engagement in order to reel in curious humans and potential victims.<p>I suspect this entire thing is a honeypot setup by scammers. It has all the tells: virality, grand promises, open source, and even the word &quot;open&quot; in the name. Humans should get used this being the new normal on the internet. Welcome to the future."

      "The great thing that a site like this can bring is helping to discover and refine anti-patterns [1]. I am a huge fan of showing valid paths to take to speed up learning, but showing dead ends, or at least sub-optimal paths, is often very helpful as well.<p>One criticism I have though is that documenting a failure doesn&#x27;t mean you actually realized what truly went wrong and even if you accurately describe what went wrong that doesn&#x27;t mean you have a real solution to that problem. Often the reason things went wrong were far more nuanced and the fix is not obvious. Adding an untested lesson at the end of each of their failures is premature. I&#x27;d call them, at best, observations and next steps to try. They are only lessons after they have truly been tested and successfully navigated around the original failure.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-pattern\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-pattern</a>",
