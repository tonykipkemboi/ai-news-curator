What should the next agent know?]<p>## Summary\n[Fill this in before committing]\n```<p>This is surprisingly effective and lets agents easily continue in progress work and understand past decisions.",
      "&gt; Checkpoints run as a Git-aware CLI. On every commit generated by an agent, it writes a structured checkpoint object and associates it with the commit SHA. The code stays exactly the same, we just add context as first-class metadata. When you push your commit, Checkpoints also pushes this metadata to a separate branch (entire&#x2F;checkpoints&#x2F;v1), giving you a complete, append-only audit log inside your repository. As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.<p>The context for every single turn could in theory be nearly 1MB.  Since this context is being stored in the repo and constantly changing, after a thousand turns, won&#x27;t it make just doing a &quot;git checkout&quot; start to be really heavy?<p>For example, codex-cli stores every single context for a given session in a jsonl file (in .codex).  I&#x27;ve easily got that file to hit 4 GB in size, just working for a few days; amusingly, codex-cli would then take many GB of RAM at startup.   I ended up writing a script that trims the jsonl history automatically periodically.   The latest codex-cli has an optional sqlite store for context state.<p>My guess is that by &quot;context&quot;, Checkpoints doesn&#x27;t actually mean the contents of the context window, but just distilled reasoning traces, which are more manageable... but still can be pretty large.",
      "&gt; Spec-driven development is becoming the primary driver of code generation.<p>This sounds like my current &quot;phase&quot; of AI coding. I have had so many project ideas for years that I can just spec out, everything I&#x27;ve thought about, all the little ideas and details, things I only had time to think about, never implement. I then feed it to Claude, and watch it meet my every specification, I can then test it, note any bugs, recompile and re-test. I can review the code, as you would a Junior you&#x27;re mentoring, and have it rewrite it in a specific pattern.<p>Funnily enough, I love Beads, but did not like that it uses git hooks for the DB, and I can&#x27;t tie tickets back to ticketing systems, so I&#x27;ve been building my own alternative, mine just syncs to and from github issues. I think this is probably overkill for whats been a solved thing: ticketing systems.",

Craft Agents does a nice job of segmenting by workspace and making skills and mcps all visible so I can understand what exactly my agent is set up to do (no black boxes).\n3. I want scheduled runs. I don&#x27;t need push, I actually kind of prefer just the reliability of scheduled, but push would be fine too. In particular, I want to:\na. After each granola meeting save in obsidian (I did this in Craft Code for example, but I prefer your more built in approach here, this is nice).\nb. On intervals, check my emails. I want to give it information on who&#x2F;what is important to me, and ping me. E.g. billing on Anthropic failed, ping me.\nc. I also want it to email back and forth to schedule with approved categories of things on request. Just get it on my calendar (share calendly, send times, etc).\nd. I want junk etc archived.\ne. For important things, update my knowledge graph (ignore spam, etc).\n4. Tying into a to-do list that actually updates based on priorities, and suggests auto archiving things etc would be good.<p>In practice, i connected gmail and asked it:\n&quot;can you archive emails that have an unsubscribe link in them (that are not currently archived)?&quot; and it got stuck on &quot;I&#x27;ll check what MCP tools are available for email operations first.&quot; But i connected gmail through your interface, and I don&#x27;t see in settings anything about it also having configured the mcp?\nI also looked at the knowledge graph and it had 20 entities, NONE of which I had any idea what they were. I&#x27;m guessing its just putting in people trying to spam me into the contacts? It didn&#x27;t finish running, but I didn&#x27;t want to burn endless tokens trying to see if it would find actual people i care about, so I shut it down. One &quot;proxy&quot; for &quot;people i care about&quot; might be &quot;people I send emails to&quot;? I could see how this is a hard problem. I also think regardless I want things more transparent. So for the moment, I&#x27;m sticking with Craft Code for this even though it is missing some major things but at least its more clear what it is: its claude code, with a nice UI.<p>Hope this was helpful.

In the meantime, I appreciate that they&#x27;re building largely in the open - every once in a while I&#x27;ll glance at their issue tracker for light bedtime reading. Just recently we had some fun internally throwing our controls software at their thermal loop as a usage example - it&#x27;s often hard to find compelling real-world systems to use as openly sharable examples (of course we have interesting customer problems, but that&#x27;s all NDA&#x27;d), so having companies build real stuff in the open is fantastic. Great company, wish them the best.",

At 30 A &#x2F; 208 V at 85% efficiency I&#x27;ve got 5 kW to work with per cabinet. If I&#x27;m putting in low core density slow machines I&#x27;ve got to do a lot more management than if I&#x27;m using my Epyc 9755 based servers. This is a practical constraint not just a theoretical &quot;oh I want the latest and greatest&quot;. It&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t really justify using up 4U and a kW on an Epyc 7003 series. The compute density just isn&#x27;t there for the power use. The old chips are practically deadweight.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad to hear of the raise because the team seems exceptional (judging by the posts you guys write and they have written prior to the company) and I love work in this area that simplifies hardware management.

Why? - because openAI claims gpt5.3-codex is too powerful and dangerous in regards to cybersecurity, and their system randomly flags accounts. And the way to unlock access to a model you thought you already were paying $200&#x2F;month for, is upload your ID and do identity verification...",

Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on.<p>&gt; This rerouting is related to our efforts to protect against cyber abuse. The gpt-5.3-codex model is our most cyber-capable reasoning model to date. It can be used as an effective tool for cyber defense applications, but it can also be exploited for malicious purposes, and we take safety seriously. When our systems detect potential cyber activity, they reroute to a different, less-capable reasoning model. We&#x27;re continuing to tune these detection mechanisms. It is important for us to get this right, especially as we prepare to make gpt-5.3-codex available to API users.<p>&gt; Refer to this article for additional information. You can go to chatgpt.com&#x2F;cyber to verify and regain gpt-5.3-codex access. We plan to add notifications in all of our Codex surfaces (TUI, extension, app, etc.) to make users aware that they are being rerouted due to these checks and provide a link to our “Trusted Access for Cyber” flow.<p>&gt; We also plan to add a dedicated button in our &#x2F;feedback flow for reporting false positive classifications. In the meantime, please use the &quot;Bug&quot; option to report issues of this type. Filing bugs in the Github issue tracker is not necessary for these issues.",

      "I was a bit confused as to how everything works until I read it in detail. Really cool tools, but I think one thing that would help in the introduction is: saying explicitly that the generated .md document is for you (the user) to read through, observe the output of the CLI call, and ensure that the output matches what you would expect.<p>It&#x27;s basically an automated test, but at a higher abstraction level and with manual verification--using CLI tools rather than a test harness. Really great work!",
      "I love your content, but I wish you&#x27;d make your blog theme responsive for wider screens&#x2F;non-mobile. I prefer to read content like this on a large screen.<p>Showboat seems like it could actually be quite useful for humans too, just for making quick notes from a CLI without opening an editor. The &quot;pop&quot; command makes me wonder if there would be a benefit to also having an array-like in addition to the stack-like interface. It seems like it would be fairly trivial to generate an index of markdown blocks so that they could be edited individually.<p>I like the idea of Rodney, but I wonder if you might actually have better results by asking the agent to generate equivalent Selenium scripts instead. I&#x27;m specifically suggesting Selenium because it&#x27;s been around so long so I assume there&#x27;s a lot of Selenium in the LLMs training data, but there are other options that might work too.",
      "Great to see you doing red&#x2F;green TDD Simon!<p>Passing tests in your repo are great documentation of the tool at a microscopic level. And rerunning tests only burns tokens on failures (since passed tests just print a dot) so it’s token efficient too.<p>Some other neat tricks:<p>- For greater efficiency configure your test runner to print nothing (not even a dot&#x2F;filename) for test successes. Agents don’t need progress dots, only the exit code &amp; failure details<p>- Have your agent implement a 10ms timeout per test. pytest has hooks to do this. The agent will see tests time out and mock out all I&#x2F;O and third party code - why test what one assumes third parties tested already! Your test suite is CPU-bound without a shared database, has no shared data and no tests that interfere with or depend on each other, so tests can run in parallel.",
      "I&#x27;ll be sure to try these out. I&#x27;ve been building my own alternative to Beads with a concept called &quot;gates&quot; which do not let you close tasks as complete until a gate passes. Would love to throw these in as &quot;gates&quot; for my current workflow.",

      "Very interesting! I encountered the problems these tools are trying to tackle just recently while trying to guide an agent into creating an in-browser tool for me. Closing the loop on a web interface isn&#x27;t as simple as CLI-only tools. I should give this a try.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that you&#x27;ve shifted to Go for your agent-coded CLI tools, Simon.",

      "Every time I say I don&#x27;t see the productivity boost from AI, people always say I&#x27;m using the wrong tool, or the wrong model. I use Claude with Sonnet, Zed with either Claude Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.6, Gemini, and ChatGPT 5.2. I use these tools daily and I just don&#x27;t see it.<p>The vampire in the room, for me, seems to be feeling like I&#x27;m the only person in the room that doesn&#x27;t believe the hype. Or should I say, being in rooms where nobody seems to care about quality over quantity anymore. Articles like this are part of the problem, not the solution.<p>Sure they are great for generating some level of code, but the deeper it goes the more it hallucinates. My first or second git commit from these tools is usually closer to a working full solution than the fifth one. The time spent refactoring prompts, testing the code, repeating instructions, refactoring naive architectural decisions and double checking hallucinations when it comes to research take more than the time AI saves me. This isn&#x27;t free.<p>A CTO this week told me he can&#x27;t code or brainstorm anymore without AI. We&#x27;ve had these tools for 4 years, like this guy says - either AI or the competition eats you. So, where is the output? Aside from more AI-tools, what has been released in the past 4 years that makes it obvious looking back that this is when AI became available?",
      "I think Yegge hit the nail on the head: he has an addiction. Opus 4.5 is awesome but the type of stuff Yegge has been saying lately has been... questionable, to say the least. The kids call it getting &quot;one-shotted by AI&quot;. Using an AI coding assistant should not be causing a person this much distress.<p>A lot of smart people think they&#x27;re &quot;too smart&quot; to get addicted. Plenty of tales of booksmart people who tried heroin and ended up stealing their mother&#x27;s jewelry for a fix a few months later.",
      "All this praise for AI.. I honestly don&#x27;t get it. I have used Opus 4.5 for work and private projects. My experience is that all of the AIs struggle when the project grows. They always find some kind of local minimum where they cannot get out of but tell you this time their solution will work.. but it doesn&#x27;t. They waste my time with this behaviour enormously. In the end I always have to do it myself.<p>Maybe when AIs are able to say: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how this works&quot; or &quot;This doesn&#x27;t work like that at all.&quot; they will be more helpful.<p>What I use AIs for is searching for stuff in large codebases. Sometimes I don&#x27;t know the name or the file name and describe to them what I am looking for. Or I let them generate some random task python&#x2F;bash script. Or use them to find specific things in a file that a regex cannot find. Simple small tasks.<p>It might well be I am doing it totally wrong.. but I have yet to see a medium to large sized project with maintainable code that was generated by AI.",
      "Some interesting parts in the text. Some not so interesting ones. The author seems to be thinking that he&#x27;s a big deal it seems, though - a month ago, I did not know who he is. My work environment has never heard of him (SDE at FAANG). Maybe I&#x27;m an outlier and he indeed influences the whole expectation management at companies with his writing, or maybe the success (?) of gastown got to him and he thinks he&#x27;s bigger than he actually is. Time will tell. In any case, the glorification of oneself in an article like that throws me off for some reason.",

Unfortunately, as AI capabilities increase, so do our expectations.<p>Suddenly, it&#x27;s no longer enough to slap something together and call it a project. The better version with more features is just one prompt away. And if you&#x27;re just a relay for prompts, why not add an agent or two?<p>I think there won&#x27;t be a future where the world adapts to a 4-hour day. If your boss or customer also sees you as a relay for prompts, they&#x27;ll slowly cut you out of the loop, or reduce the amount they pay you. If you instead want to maintain some moat, or build your own money-maker, your working hours will creep up again.<p>In this environment, I don&#x27;t see this working out financially for most people. We need to decide which future we want:<p>1. the one where people can survive (and thrive) without stable employment;<p>2. the one where we stop automating in favor of stable employment; or<p>3. the one where only those who keep up stay afloat.",

      "&gt;With a 10x boost, if you give an engineer Claude Code, then once they’re fluent, their work stream will produce nine additional engineers’ worth of value.<p>I keep hearing about this 10x productivity, but where is it materializing?

      "He talks about this new tech for extracting more value from engineers as if it were fracking. When they become impermeable you can now inject a mixed high pressure cocktail of AI to get their internal hydrocarbons flowing. It works but now he feels all pumped out. But the vampire metaphor is hopefully better in that blood replenishes if you don&#x27;t take too much. A succubus may be an improved comparison, in that a creative seed is extracted and depleted, then refills over a refractory period."
