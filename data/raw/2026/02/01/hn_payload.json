      "&gt; If you look at the security measures in other coding agents, they&#x27;re mostly security theater. As soon as your agent can write code and run code, it&#x27;s pretty much game over.<p>At least for Codex, the agent runs commands inside an OS-provided sandbox (Seatbelt on macOS, and other stuff on other platforms).  It does not end up &quot;making the agent mostly useless&quot;.",
      "I&#x27;ve seen a couple of power users already switching to Pi [1], and I&#x27;m considering that too.

I&#x27;d rather use mcporter [5]<p>Full control over context is a high-leverage capability. If you&#x27;re aware of the many limitations of context on performance (in-context retrieval limits [6], context rot [7], etc.), you&#x27;d truly appreciate Pi lets you fine-tune context for optimal performance.<p>It&#x27;s clearly not for everyone, but I can see how powerful it can be.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucumr.pocoo.org&#x2F;2026&#x2F;1&#x2F;31&#x2F;pi&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucumr.pocoo.org&#x2F;2026&#x2F;1&#x2F;31&#x2F;pi&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;badlogic&#x2F;pi-mono&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;coding-agent#system-prompt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;badlogic&#x2F;pi-mono&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;codin...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mitsuhiko&#x2F;agent-stuff&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;pi-extensions&#x2F;todos.ts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mitsuhiko&#x2F;agent-stuff&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;pi-extens...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nicobailon&#x2F;pi-mcp-adapter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nicobailon&#x2F;pi-mcp-adapter</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;steipete&#x2F;mcporter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;steipete&#x2F;mcporter</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gkamradt&#x2F;LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gkamradt&#x2F;LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack</a><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.trychroma.com&#x2F;context-rot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.trychroma.com&#x2F;context-rot</a>",

      "I dont know how to feel about being the only one refusing to run yolo mode until the tooling is there, which is still about 6 months away for my setup. Am I years behind everyone else by then? You can get pretty far without completely giving in. Agents really dont need to execute that many arbitrary commands. linting, search, edit, web access should all be bespoke tools integrated into the permission and sandbox system. agents should not even be allowed to start and stop applications that support dev mode, they edit files, can test and get the logs what else would they need to do? especially as the amount of external dependencies that make sense goes to a handful you can without headache approve every new one. If your runtime supports sandboxing and permissions like deno or workerd this adds an initial layer of defense.<p>This makes it even more baffling why anthropic went with bun, a runtime without any sandboxing or security\narchitecture and will rely in apple seatbelt alone?",
      "Being minimalist is real power these days as everything around us keeps shoving features in our face every week with a million tricks and gimmicks to learn. Something minimalist like this is honestly a breath of fresh air!<p>The YOLO mode is also good, but having a small ‘baby setting mode’ that’s not full-blown system access would make sense for basic security. Just a sensible layer of &quot;pls don&#x27;t blow my machine&quot; without killing the freedom :)",
      "Armin Ronacher wrote a good piece about why he uses Pi here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucumr.pocoo.org&#x2F;2026&#x2F;1&#x2F;31&#x2F;pi&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucumr.pocoo.org&#x2F;2026&#x2F;1&#x2F;31&#x2F;pi&#x2F;</a><p>I hadn&#x27;t realized that Pi is the agent harness used by OpenClaw.",

      "If you&#x27;re interacting with stateful systems (which you usually are with this kind of command), --dry-run can still have a race condition.<p>The tool tells you what it would do in the current situation, you take a look and confirm that that&#x27;s alright. Then you run it again without --dry-run, in a potentially different situation.<p>That&#x27;s why I prefer Terraform&#x27;s approach of having a &quot;plan&quot; mode. It doesn&#x27;t just tell you what it would do but does so in the form of a plan it can later execute programmatically. Then, if any of the assumptions made during planning have changed, it can abort and roll back.<p>As a nice bonus, this pattern gives a good answer to the problem of having &quot;if dry_run:&quot; sprinkled everywhere: You have to separate the planning and execution in code anyway, so you can make the &quot;just apply immediately&quot; mode simply execute(plan()).",
      "I like this pattern a lot, but it&#x27;s important that the code in the dry path is representative. I&#x27;ve been bitten a few too many times by dry code that just runs `print(&quot;would have updated ID: 123&quot;)`, but not actually running most of the code in the hot path. Then when I run it for real, some of the prep for the write operation has a bug &#x2F; error, so my dry run didn&#x27;t actually reveal much to me.<p>Put another way: your dry code should do everything up until the point that database writes &#x2F; API calls &#x2F; etc actually happen. Don&#x27;t bail too early",
      "I like the opposite too, -commit or -execute as it is assumed running it with defaults is immutable as the dry run, simplifying validation complexity and making the go live explicit.",
      "In order to make it work without polluting the code-base I find that I have to move the persistence into injectable strategy, which makes it good anyway. If you keep passing in `if dry_run:` everywhere you&#x27;re screwed.<p>Also, if I&#x27;m being honest, it&#x27;s much better to use `--wet-run` for the production run than to ask people to run `--dry-run` for the test run. Less likely to accidentally fire off the real stuff.",
      "I prefer “—really-do”, so the default behaviour of the tool is to do nothing. That’s more fault tolerant for the scenario you forget to add “—dry-run”.",
      "Funny, I recalled a tool called &quot;molly-guard&quot; which solves the problem when you want to reboot a Unix server, but can be on the wrong one. It asks to type the server name.<p>Anybody who rebooted a wrong server can say that this tool is brilliant.<p>Like &quot;--dry-run&quot; but for &quot;reboot.&quot;",
      "One of the kick-ass feature of PowerShell is you only need to add `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)] ` to have the `-whatIf` dry-run for your functions.<p>Quite handy.",
      "I usually do the opposite and add a --really flag to my CLI utilities, so that they are read-only by default and extra effort is needed to screw things up.",
      "In one (internal) CLI I maintain, I actually put the `if not dry_run:` inside the code which calls the REST API, because I have a setting to log HTTP calls as CURL commands, and that way in dry-run mode I can get the HTTP calls it would have made without it actually making them.<p>And this works well if your CLI command is simply performing a single operation, e.g. call this REST API<p>But the moment it starts to do anything more complex: e.g. call API1, and then send the results of API1 to API2 – it becomes a lot more difficult<p>Of course, you can simulate what API1 is likely to have returned; but suddenly you have something a lot more complex and error-prone than just `if not dry_run:`",
      "For me the ideal case is three-state. When run interactively with no flags, print a dry run result and prompt the user to confirm the action; and choose a default for non-interactive invocations. In both cases, accept either a --dry-run or a --yes flag that indicates the choice to be made.<p>This should always be included in any application that has a clear plan-then-execute flow, and it&#x27;s definitely nice to have in other cases as well."

      "WhatsApp&#x27;s end-to-end encryption has been independently investigated: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kclpure.kcl.ac.uk&#x2F;ws&#x2F;files&#x2F;324396471&#x2F;whatsapp.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kclpure.kcl.ac.uk&#x2F;ws&#x2F;files&#x2F;324396471&#x2F;whatsapp.pdf</a><p>Full version here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2025&#x2F;794.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2025&#x2F;794.pdf</a><p>We didn&#x27;t review the entire source code, only the cryptographic core. That said, the main issue we found was that the WhatsApp servers ultimately decide who is and isn&#x27;t in a particular chat. Dan Goodin wrote about it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;2025&#x2F;05&#x2F;whatsapp-provides-no-cryptographic-management-for-group-messages&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;2025&#x2F;05&#x2F;whatsapp-provides-n...</a>",
      "No closed-source E2EE client can be truly secure because the ends of e2e are opaque.<p>Detecting backdoors is only truly feasible with open source software and even then it can difficult.<p>A backdoor can be a subtle remote code execution &quot;vulnerability&quot; that can only be exploited by the server. If used carefully and it exfiltrates data in expected client-server communications it can be all but impossible to detect. This approach also makes it more likely that almost no insider will even be aware of it, it could be a small patch applied during the build process or to the binary itself (for example, a bound check branch). This is also another reason why reproducible builds are a good idea for open source software.",
      "Ex-WhatsApp engineer here. WhatsApp team makes so much effort to make this end to end encrypted messages possible. From the time I worked I know for sure it is not possible to read the encrypted messages.<p>From business standpoint they don’t have to read these messages, since WhatsApp business API provide the necessary funding for the org as a whole.",
      "Matthew Green&#x27;s take from 3 days ago:<p>&gt; There’s a lawsuit against WhatsApp making the rounds today, claiming that Meta has access to plaintext. I see nothing in there that’s compelling; the whole thing sounds like a fishing expedition.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;matthewdgreen.bsky.social&#x2F;post&#x2F;3mdglo2z6i22i\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;matthewdgreen.bsky.social&#x2F;post&#x2F;3mdg...</a>",
      "None of the statements I’ve seen from Meta, people formerly involved in WhatsApp that chimed in here (thanks!), or the quotes from the investigation are incompatible with the whistleblowers’ allegations.<p>At this point, I won’t trust anything short of this on the front page of an SEC filing, signed by zuck and the relevant management chain:<p>“The following statement is material to earnings:  Facebook has never (since E2EE was rolled out) and will never access messages sent through whatsapp via any means including the encryption protocol, application backdoor moderation access or backup mechanisms.  Similarly, it does not provide third parties with access to the methods, and does not have the technical capability to do so under any circumstances.”",
      "Just to throw in a couple of possibly outlandish theories:<p>1. as others have said, they could be collecting the encrypted messages and then tried to decrypt them using quantum computing, the Chinese have been reportedly trying to do this for many years now.<p>2. with metadata and all the information from other sources, they could infer what the conversation is about without the need to decrypt it: if I visit a page (Facebook cookies, they know), then I share a message to my friend John, and then John visits the same page (again, cookies), then they can be pretty certain that the contain of the message was me sharing the link.",
      "I wonder how these investigations go? Are they just asking them if it is true? Are they working with IT specialist to technically analyze the apps? Are they requesting the source code that can be demonstrated to be the same one that runs on the user devices and then analyze that code?",
      "I said this in another recent HN thread but all encryption comes down to key management. If you don’t control the keys, something else does. Sometimes that’s a hardware enclave, sometimes it’s a key derivation algorithm, sometimes it’s just a locally generated key on the filesystem.<p>If you never give WhatsApp a cryptographic identity then what key is it using? How are your messages seamlessly showing up on another device when you authenticate? It’s not magic, and these convenience features always weaken the crypto in some way.<p>WhatsApp has a feature to verify the fingerprint of another party. How many people do you think use this feature, versus how many people just assume they&#x27;re safe because they read that WhatsApp has E2EE?",
      "I witnessed something recently that points unambiguously at Whatsapp chats being not private.<p>Not two months ago I sent a single photo to a friend of some random MacGyver kitchen contraption I made. Never described it, just a photo with the lol. He replied lol. He never reshared nor discussed it with anyone else. We never spoke about this before or after. Two days later he starts seeing ads on Facebook for a proper version of the same. There&#x27;s virtually no other explanation except for Meta vacuuming and analyzing the photo. None."

When Karpathy admits he barely writes code directly anymore, when the Claude Code team ships 20+ PRs daily with 100% AI-written code, we’re past the point of dismissing this as hype.<p>Oh a company 100% invested in AI hype says they have 100% AI-written code PRs. Water is still wet. CC Team is least trustable team when it comes to judging how good AI is.<p>Also, to Pro-AI people, if you really believe that models are going to become much better from now, why shouldnt we just wait for those models rather than building tech debt at a scale unseen before 2025?"

      "It really sucks that Supabase is what LLMs default to. Supabase has an innate problem.<p>- RLS asks for way more discipline to use securely than the bog-standard &quot;client+API+SQL db&quot;<p>- Supabase has spent all of its marketing budget on beginners (pre-LLMs) and completely non-technical users (post-LLMs)<p>This combination is always going to lead to complete trainwrecks. It&#x27;s like marketing angle grinders to people who have never learnt to use a saw.<p>The chance of Supabase ever changing from RLS-first to RLS-last is near zero as well as it&#x27;s too core to their brand. As long as it&#x27;s RLS-first it doesn&#x27;t matter how many &quot;barriers&quot; and &quot;checks&quot; they put up either. They will never put up enough to slow adoption, which is what would be needed.<p>It would be much better for everyone if the standard vibe coding stack was based on, for example, Cloudflare. Pages&#x2F;Workers&#x2F;D1 or something. Not that I&#x27;m a fan of CF (and there may be better alternatives) but at least it would cut these cases of &quot;entire DB exposed&quot; at least in half.<p>Another bit of irony is that the whole selling point of Supabase has been &quot;time from zero to one&quot;, &quot;less code&#x2F;boilerplate required&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a frontend developer and don&#x27;t want to learn backend&quot;. But those things are <i>exactly</i> things that LLMs already solve, especially for vibecoders who don&#x27;t even know what the code is doing. For them it&#x27;d be so much better if the LLM just went with the standard SQL setup rather than Supabase&#x2F;RLS.",
