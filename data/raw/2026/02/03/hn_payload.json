      "The real value here isn&#x27;t in the config syncing itself - it&#x27;s in forcing you to articulate your project context once.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Cursor heavily for building internal tools, and the biggest productivity gains came from investing time in detailed skills files that explain the codebase architecture, naming conventions, and common patterns.<p>Without something like LNAI, the natural tendency is to just use the default configs and wonder why the AI keeps suggesting solutions that don&#x27;t match your existing patterns. The act of writing &quot;here&#x27;s how we structure components&quot; once, and having that context available everywhere, changes the quality of suggestions dramatically.<p>The debate about whether unified prompts are better or worse than tool-specific ones misses this point. The 80&#x2F;20 is getting the project context documented at all. Whether you tweak prompts per model is optimization at the margins compared to having zero documented context.<p>One thing I&#x27;d add: skills work best when they&#x27;re specific about what NOT to do. &quot;Don&#x27;t create new utility files, add to existing ones&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t use class components&quot; saves more correction time than positive instructions.",
      "Hmm, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it&#x27;s a good thing the different agents use different files, different models needs different prompts. Using the same system&#x2F;user prompts across all three will just give you slightly worse results in one of them, instead of getting the best results you can from each one of them. At least for the general steering system prompts.<p>Then for the application specific documentation, I&#x27;d understand you&#x27;d want to share it, as it stays the same for all agents touching the same codebase. But easily solved by putting it in DESIGN.md or whatever and appending &quot;Remember to check against DESIGN.md before changing the architecture&quot; or similar.",

      "This solves distribution well. Curious about the change propagation story though - what happens when you update your .ai&#x2F; source and tools have cached&#x2F;transformed versions?<p>I ran into this building a spec&#x2F;skill sync system [1] - the &quot;sync once&quot; model breaks down when you need to track whether downstream consumers are aware of upstream changes.<p><pre><code>  [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anupamchugh&#x2F;shadowbook</code></pre>",
      "Nice. The config fragmentation across tools is a real annoyance\n Does it handle conflicts if tools expect different formats for the same setting?",
      "I’ve been using chezmoi to manage dot files, that should be enough to handle AI config too. It’s easier to just have one tool do all of that.",
      "I&#x27;ve been using Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex on the same projects. Each tool has its own config format: Claude wants `.claude&#x2F;`, Cursor wants `.cursor&#x2F;`, Codex wants `.codex&#x2F;`. Every time I updated a skill&#x2F;rule, I had to update it in 3+ places. Usually I&#x27;d forget one, and my tools would give inconsistent suggestions.\nLNAI is a CLI that lets you define your AI configs once in a `.ai&#x2F;` directory:<p>.ai&#x2F;\n├── AGENTS.md\n├── rules&#x2F;\n├── skills&#x2F;\n└── settings.json # MCP servers, permissions<p>Run `lnai sync` and it exports to native formats for 7 tools: Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Windsurf, and Codex.\nThe interesting part is it&#x27;s not just copying files. Each tool has quirks:<p>- Cursor wants `.mdc` files with `globs` arrays in frontmatter\n- Gemini reads rules at the directory level, so rules get grouped\n- Permissions like `Bash(git:*)` become `Shell(git)` for Cursor\n- Some tools don&#x27;t support certain features (e.g., Cursor has no &quot;ask&quot; permission level). LNAI warns but doesn&#x27;t fail<p>Where possible, it uses symlinks. So `.claude&#x2F;CLAUDE.md` → `..&#x2F;.ai&#x2F;AGENTS.md`. Edit the source, all tools see the change immediately without re-syncing.<p>Usage:<p>npm install -g lnai\nlnai init # Creates .ai&#x2F; directory\nlnai validate # Checks for config errors\nlnai sync # Exports to all enabled tools<p>It&#x27;s MIT licensed. The code is TypeScript with a plugin architecture, each tool is a plugin that implements import&#x2F;export&#x2F;validate.\nGitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KrystianJonca&#x2F;lnai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KrystianJonca&#x2F;lnai</a>\nDocs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnai.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnai.sh</a><p>Would appreciate feedback, especially from anyone else dealing with this config hell problem.",

      "The bias-variance framing here maps well to what I&#x27;ve observed building AI-assisted workflows.<p>In practice, systematic misalignment (bias) is relatively easy to fix - you identify the pattern and add it to your prompt&#x2F;context. &quot;Always use our internal auth library&quot; works reliably once specified.<p>Variance-dominated failures are a different beast. The same prompt, same context, same model can produce wildly different quality outputs on complex tasks. I&#x27;ve seen this most acutely when asking models to maintain consistency across multi-file changes.<p>The paper&#x27;s finding that &quot;larger models + harder problems = more variance&quot; explains something I couldn&#x27;t quite articulate before: why Sonnet sometimes outperforms Opus on specific workflows. The &quot;smarter&quot; model attempts more sophisticated solutions, but the solution space it&#x27;s exploring has more local minima where it can get stuck.<p>One practical takeaway: decomposing complex tasks into smaller, well-specified subtasks doesn&#x27;t just help with context limits - it fundamentally changes the bias&#x2F;variance profile of each inference call. You&#x27;re trading one high-variance call for multiple lower-variance calls, which tends to be more predictable even if it requires more orchestration overhead.",
      "The comments so far seem focused on taking a cheap shot, but as somebody working on using AI to help people with hard, long-term tasks, it&#x27;s a valuable piece of writing.<p>- It&#x27;s short and to the point<p>- It&#x27;s actionable in the short term (make sure the tasks per session aren&#x27;t too difficult) and useful for researchers in the long term<p>- It&#x27;s informative on how these models work, informed by some of the best in the business<p>- It gives us a specific vector to look at, clearly defined (&quot;coherence&quot;, or, more fun, &quot;hot mess&quot;)",
      "&gt;  Making models larger improves overall accuracy but doesn&#x27;t reliably reduce incoherence on hard problems.<p>Coherence requires 2 opposing forces to hold coherence in one dimension and at least 3 of them in higher dimensions of quality.<p>My team wrote up a paper titled &quot;If You Want Coherence, Orchestrate a Team of Rivals&quot;[1] because we kept finding that upping the reasoning threshold resulted in less coherence - more experimentation before we hit a dead-end to turn around.<p>So we had a better result from using Haiku (we fail over to Sonnet) over Opus and using a higher reasoning model to decompose tasks rather than perform each one of them.<p>Once a plan is made, the cheaper models do better as they do not double-think their approaches - they fail or they succeed, they are not as tenacious as the higher cost models.<p>We can escalate to higher authority and get out of that mess faster if we fail hard and early.<p>The knowledge of how exactly failure happened seems to be less useful to the higher reasoning model over the action biased models.<p>Splitting up the tactical and strategic sides of the problem, seems to work similarly to how Generals don&#x27;t hold guns in a war.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2601.14351\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2601.14351</a>",
      "This is a good line: &quot;It found that smarter entities are subjectively judged to behave less coherently&quot;<p>I think this is twofold:<p>1. Advanced intelligence requires the ability to traverse between domain valleys in the cognitive manifold. Be it via temperature or some fancy tunneling technique, it&#x27;s going to be higher error (less coherent) in the valleys of the manifold than naive gradient following to the local minima.<p>2. It&#x27;s hard to &quot;punch up&quot; when evaluating intelligence. When someone is a certain amount smarter than you, distinguishing their plausible bullshit from their deep insights is really, really hard.",
      "You simply can&#x27;t have a single shot context with so many simultaneous constraints and expect to make forward progress. This cannot be solved with additional silicon, power or data.<p>Smaller prompts and fewer tools tends to be more stable. I try to stay within 1000 tokens and 10 tools for a single inference pass. I become visibly amused when I read many of the system prompts out there. Anthropomorphism is the biggest anti pattern with these models. It&#x27;s a very easy and comfortable trap to fall into.<p>The core issue I see with coding agents is that the moment you read a file, you&#x27;ve polluted the context in terms of token coherence. It&#x27;s probably not critical in most cases, but it&#x27;s safer to pretend like it is. Recursive&#x2F;iterative decomposition of the problem is the only thing I&#x27;ve seen so far that can scale arbitrarily. For example, if you invoke a sub agent every time you read a file, you can reduce the impact to the token budget of the caller by orders of magnitude. The callee can return a brief summary or yes&#x2F;no response to the caller after reading 500kb of source. This applies at each level of recursion and can compound dramatically (exponentially) over just a few nested calls.",
      "I think It&#x27;s not because AI working on &quot;misaligned&quot; goals. The user never specify the goal clearly enough for AI system to work.<p>However, I think producing detailed enough specification requires same or even larger amount of work than writing code. We write rough specification and clarify these during the process of coding. I think there are minimal effort required to produce these specification, AI will not help you speed up these effort.",
      "The &quot;natural overthinking increases incoherence&quot; finding matches my daily experience with Claude.<p>I maintain ~100 custom skills (specialized prompts). Sometimes Claude reads a skill, understands it, then overthinks itself into &quot;helpful&quot; variations that break the workflow.<p>Has anyone else found prompt density affects coherence?",
      "This matches my intuition. Systematic misalignment seems like it could be prevented by somewhat simple rules like the hippocratic oath or Asimov&#x27;s Laws of robotics or rather probabilistic bayesian versions of these rules that take into account error bounds and risk.<p>The probabilistic version of &quot;Do No Harm&quot; is &quot;Do not take excessive risk of harm&quot;.<p>This should work as AIs become smarter because intelligence implies becoming better bayesians which implies being great at calibrating confidence intervals of their interpretations and their reasoning and basically gaining a superhuman ability for evaluating the bounds of ambiguity and risk.<p>Now this doesn&#x27;t mean that AIs won&#x27;t be misaligned, only that it should be possible to align them. Not every AI maker will necessarily bother to align them properly, especially in adversarial, military applications.",

What&#x27;s interesting about modeling it as a &quot;service&quot; is it forces you to think about latency budgets, retry logic, and fallback behavior. Same primitives we use for calling external APIs.<p>Curious about the actual implementation: when an agent calls Ask-a-Human, what does the human-side interface look like? A queue of pending questions? Push notifications? The &quot;inference time&quot; (how fast a human responds) is going to be the bottleneck for any real-time use case.",
